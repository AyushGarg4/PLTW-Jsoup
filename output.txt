I sell baseball cards on eBay and needed a binder to help organize some of my cards.

Dear Edward V,

We have currently got magic cards on sale. We saw your review (5.0/5.0):

I’ve always been a “3 ringed” binder kind of guy when it came to holding my magic cards.
        Even though this binder doesn’t have the same convenience of inserting and taking out pages,
        I can see why a lot of people are using these new type of side load binder pages. The soft,
        black backing of the pages feel like they’ll take good care of your cards and are not as
        rough as the clear plastic pages that I’m used to. But the thing I like the most about these
        black pages is that they make your magic cards look REALLY good; The black backing combined
        with the black borders of magic cards just creates a nice visual presentation right when you
        open up the binder to look at your collection. As for the rest of the binder, the zipper
        works well and ensures that none of your cards are gonna fall out of your binder. The
        material of the binder is smooth and feels good to the touch, very similar to your typical
        school zipper binders. Overall, this is a solid binder that you will be happy with to hold
        your cards and will make your collection even more pleasing to look at.

Dear Amazon Customer Amazon Customer,

We have currently got pokemon cards on sale. We saw your review (5.0/5.0):

I love this card holder, it's the perfect color combo for holding pokemon cards. It's
        not branded for Pokemon, but who can mistake the color combo? The feel of it is nice, it's a
        great, portable size, and it zips closed to secure any cards in case they fall out, and to
        keep the elements away from my collection. There is a nice, sturdy hand strap as well that
        can be used with a carabiner to attach to a backpack or just used to carry it around. This
        set comes with 50 sleeves, that when full will take up the entire binder. The sleeves
        themselves, and the holder, are not 8.5 x 11 binder sized (those hold 9 per side), they are
        smaller and each sleeve will carry 8 cards total, 4 on each side. The pockets are oversized
        and pokemon cards float around a bit in them. I assume this is to handle cards of varying
        sizes, so it's definitely nice that there is a zippered closure to keep loose cards from
        falling out. This certainly can't hold all of my cards, but the real use for this is to hold
        sets that you're going to use when playing the game. For that purpose, the size is perfect!
        The sleeve material feels a bit thin, so I do worry about how well they will last when
        taking cards in and out frequently. The material on my full size binder sleeves are much
        thicker. I suppose if they wear out, I'll need to look for replacements. This holder does
        look great, it's a good size for traveling, and I like the zippered closure, so I definitely
        recommend this for any pokemon card gaming fans out there!

I liked the vintage style and inclusion of players such as Hank Aaron. I hate the tiny
        little cards and the stupid things like birds and instruments. It would be great if they
        didn't have the non baseball things and no tiny cards.

Dear Stan Da Man,

We have currently got baseball cards on sale. We saw your review (5.0/5.0):

I recently purchased the Ultra PRO 3'' x 4'' Clear Regular Top Loaders for my baseball
        card collection, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed! These top loaders are exactly
        what any collector would want to keep their cards in pristine condition. The clarity of the
        plastic is top-notch, allowing me to view my cards without taking them out and risking
        damage. The size is perfect for standard baseball cards, providing a snug fit that prevents
        the cards from moving around inside. What I appreciate most is the durability of these top
        loaders. They feel sturdy and are thick enough to protect the cards from bending or
        creasing. Despite their sturdiness, they're not bulky, which makes storing and displaying my
        collection easy and convenient. Another great feature is the ease of use. Sliding cards in
        and out of the top loaders is a breeze, which is a big plus when I'm sorting or showing my
        collection to friends. I've used other brands in the past, but these are by far the most
        user-friendly. The Ultra PRO 3'' x 4'' Clear Regular Top Loaders are a fantastic investment
        for any baseball card collector. They offer the perfect blend of clarity, protection, and
        convenience. Highly recommended for keeping your cherished collection safe and in mint
        condition!

These baseball cards were a huge hit with my Grandsons (age 9 and 6) on Christmas
        morning. I had no idea they would be such a great gift as I ordered them just for a stocking
        stuffer type gift. They loved them, compared them, put them in their special binders, even
        had a small tiff over them when one got put in the wrong binder. I forget what they cost but
        they were worth every penny.

Dear Ian E.,

We have currently got baseball cards on sale. We saw your review (5.0/5.0):

I recently purchased the Ultra PRO Clear Card Sleeves for Standard Size Trading Cards,
        and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with their quality and affordability. These card
        sleeves have proven to be an excellent low-cost solution for protecting my precious baseball
        card collection. The sleeves are made from a durable and crystal-clear material that allows
        me to admire the cards' details while providing a strong layer of protection against dust,
        dirt, and minor scratches. They fit standard size trading cards perfectly, ensuring a snug
        and secure fit. What sets these card sleeves apart is their incredible value for the price.
        The pack contains a generous quantity of sleeves, making it a cost-effective option for
        collectors with large card collections. Despite the affordability, the sleeves don't
        compromise on quality. I appreciate how easy it is to slide the cards into the sleeves
        without any issues, and the sleeves' transparency allows me to easily identify and organize
        my cards without removing them from the protection. Overall, the Ultra PRO Clear Card
        Sleeves have exceeded my expectations, providing excellent protection and value for my
        baseball card collection.

We got this for our son for Christmas because he has recently became obsessed with
        baseball/football/basketball cards. He was so excited with this and loves that it holds so
        many cards. It is very well made and durable. We love the design and the extra caution taken
        on how the card slots are designed to prevent cards from falling out. Would definitely
        recommend!
