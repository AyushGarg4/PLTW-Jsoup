      <text>Got these for my boys for Easter and they loved them. I think they preferred that there
        were old and new cards combined. In their words ‚Äúit‚Äôs better to have some from all eras and
        they are mostly good, instead of all new players and a lot of them aren‚Äôt that great‚Äù
        (referencing the new foil packs) there were cards we had never seen before. Highly recommend
        for any new collectors or kids who just like to be surprised. Attached is some of my son‚Äôs
        favorites from the set.</text>

      <text>These baseball cards were a huge hit with my Grandsons (age 9 and 6) on Christmas
        morning. I had no idea they would be such a great gift as I ordered them just for a stocking
        stuffer type gift. They loved them, compared them, put them in their special binders, even
        had a small tiff over them when one got put in the wrong binder. I forget what they cost but
        they were worth every penny.</text>

      <text>I‚Äôm building a collection of Pok√©mon cards to be able to trade with my 6 year old
        grandson. It‚Äôs so much fun. We‚Äôre learning how to play the game,too. I ordered these hoping
        to build my trading set. They are awesome. Many cards over 100 power. Only 1 duplicate. I‚Äôll
        be ordering another set today and will report back. Hope the next is as much fun as the
        first. Starting collect? Go ahead and buy. It‚Äôs fun. These are good.</text>

      <text>For the clueless parents and grandparents out there, you won't b able to play the game
        with one purchase of these cards or even 10 sets of these cards. You'd need to get a Starter
        Set first. But if your kids already have a Starter Set this is a good value. Considering the
        playing instructions suggest that you should place four Basic, three Stage 1 and two Stage 2
        cards for each full evolution line of these pocket monsters into your Playing Deck, this is
        a good value to build up your lower ranks. Whoever designed this game was brilliant, not
        only do you "gotta get them all" but you gotta get multiples of each. Truly a money making
        business model. Doubtful you will find any Stage2 in this purchase. My purchase included: 33
        Basic Cards 11 Stage One cards 2 Energy Cards 4 Item/Supporter cards Not a bad value. The
        cards were all in good condition.</text>

      <text>I recently purchased the Pokemon TCG: Random Cards from Every Series, 50 Cards in Each
        Lot, and my experience falls in the middle ground, warranting a three-star review. Here's a
        breakdown of my observations: **Pros:** 1. **Variety in Series:** The promise of cards from
        every series is delivered upon. I appreciated the diverse mix of cards, spanning various
        generations of Pokemon, which added an element of nostalgia and excitement. 2. **Quantity in
        Each Lot:** The inclusion of 50 cards in each lot offers a decent quantity for collectors or
        players looking to expand their collection without breaking the bank. It provides a good
        starting point for those who enjoy the surprise element of random cards. 3. **Potential for
        Rare Finds:** The randomness of the cards introduces an element of surprise, and there's a
        chance of discovering rare or holographic cards. This unpredictability adds a layer of
        thrill to each lot. **Cons:** 1. **Condition Discrepancies:** While some cards were in
        excellent condition, there were noticeable discrepancies in the conditions of others. A few
        cards showed signs of wear, including creases and frayed edges, which was disappointing for
        collectors aiming for pristine cards. 2. **Limited Playability:** For those who are not
        solely collectors but also players, the random assortment may result in a lack of synergy or
        playability in constructing decks. It's a gamble whether the cards received will contribute
        meaningfully to one's gameplay strategy. 3. **Potential for Duplicates:** In my experience,
        there were instances of receiving duplicate cards within the same lot. While duplicates are
        common in randomized sets, the frequency was higher than expected and diminished the
        excitement of discovery. 4. **Lack of Packaging Information:** The cards arrived without
        specific information on the packaging regarding the series or sets included. This made it
        challenging to identify the origin of certain cards, particularly for collectors who
        appreciate categorization. 5. **No Guarantee of Rare Cards:** While the potential for rare
        finds is mentioned as a pro, the flip side is the lack of a guarantee. Some lots may not
        contain any exceptionally rare or valuable cards, which could be a letdown for those hoping
        for standout additions to their collection. In summary, the Pokemon TCG: Random Cards from
        Every Series, 50 Cards in Each Lot, offers a mixed experience. The variety and quantity are
        commendable, but the condition discrepancies, playability challenges, and the potential for
        duplicates create a somewhat unpredictable and inconsistent outcome. It's a suitable option
        for collectors seeking a diverse assortment but may leave some players or enthusiasts
        wanting more consistency and value.</text>

      <text>It should say NO RARES AT ALL in the top description paragraphs, not on one line all the
        way down the page. (Feb 2024). Apparently somebody does get a rare once in a while. Some
        people get TONS of duplicates. or even ONLY COMMONS. What the Kid gifted this got, and
        enjoyed: 13 Uncommons 38 Commons Total = 51 0 Rares 0 Holos / Foils / Reverses / Full Arts 0
        Trainer cards 0 Stage 2's Overall: Decent mix of colors nice to see a couple stage 1's that
        evolve from included basics. Good mix of what was there however, completed a couple of basic
        / stage 1 evo lines the kid only had the other half. I think there was maybe 1 duplicate.
        From the reviews however, I would consider this pack "lucky", or at least not "unlucky".
        Happy Kid, happy gifter, and having sometimes played tcg/ccg it did seem like good for what
        it was. I'd say if don't want to be guaranteed evo blocks, and you don't get this thing in
        the "unlucky" form, it's good for 4 bucks. Obviously you're overcharged for these cards at
        singles prices, but someone assembling it and shipping it is going to cost something folks,
        let's keep it real. Value is "as expected" ( BUT ONLY AFTER reading the fine print and
        realizing I got something with ZERO rares, that's why I'm docking a star. SAY IT AT THE TOP
        PLEASE, LIKE THIS ISN'T AN INJECTION, DON'T HIDE THE TRUTH)</text>

      <text>Very pleased with card binder. Would definitely recommend if you are on the fence, maybe
        buy larger if you are a real card collector, but this will get the job done if you card
        collection is modest. Nice sleeves and solid.</text>

      <text>The media could not be loaded. Great binder, wonder amount of space between the bend of
        the binder and the pages so no cards would get warped over time the closer they are to the
        crease 10/10</text>

      <text>Fits standard top-loaders beautifully, as advertised. They fit a little loosely if the
        slot behind the filled one is empty. (If you have a slot on the front side of a page filled,
        put one on the backside to keep that one from flopping around while you transport the
        binder.) My solution to that was just to load 8 cards at a time and fill both sides of a
        page at once.</text>

      <text>The top loader trading card sleeves has proven to be a game-changer in safeguarding and
        enhancing the longevity of my cherished card collection. These transparent protective
        sleeves have not only exceeded my expectations in terms of durability but have also elevated
        the overall presentation of my cards, ensuring a secure haven for my most prized
        collectibles. The primary standout feature of these top loader sleeves is their robust
        construction. Crafted from sturdy and rigid materials, these sleeves offer a solid defense
        against external elements, preventing bends, creases, and other potential damage to my
        valuable trading cards. The top-loading design simplifies the insertion and removal process
        while providing an extra layer of protection for the cards. The clarity of the sleeves is
        commendable, allowing the vibrant colors and intricate details of my trading cards to shine
        through. The crystal-clear transparency ensures that each card remains easily visible and
        aesthetically pleasing, maintaining the visual appeal of my collection without compromising
        on protection. The sizing of the top loader sleeves is precise, catering to standard trading
        card dimensions. This snug fit ensures a secure enclosure, preventing any unnecessary
        movement that could lead to wear and tear. Additionally, the sleeves feature a reliable
        closure mechanism, keeping the cards firmly in place while allowing for easy access when
        needed. The archival quality of these sleeves is a significant advantage for collectors
        aiming to preserve their cards for the long term. The materials used are free from harmful
        acids and PVC, preventing potential damage to the cards over time. This archival-grade
        feature is especially crucial for those with rare or vintage cards, ensuring that the
        sleeves contribute to the preservation of their monetary and sentimental value. The top
        loader sleeves have proven to be versatile in accommodating different card thicknesses.
        Whether I'm housing standard trading cards or thicker specialty cards, these sleeves offer
        flexibility without compromising on protection. This adaptability is appreciated, allowing
        me to use the same sleeves for various cards within my collection. The purchase experience
        was seamless, with the sleeves arriving promptly and securely packaged. The user-friendly
        design of the packaging, including clear labeling and quantity information, made it easy to
        organize and store the sleeves for future use. In conclusion, the top loader trading card
        sleeves have proven to be an essential investment for any serious collector. Their robust
        construction, clarity, archival quality, and versatility make them a standout choice for
        protecting and showcasing trading card collections. If you're looking to preserve the
        integrity and visual appeal of your valuable cards, these top loader sleeves are a reliable
        and worthwhile addition to your collecting arsenal.</text>

      <text>They are nice but I had about 15 per box that were stuck together from what appears to
        be excess heat during manufacturing. They had to be cracked open to be able to put in a
        card. This left a few marks on the inside of the toploader which I did not like so they were
        discarded. Overall this is a mediocre purchase. Thanks</text>

      <text>These are very transparent and seem durable, I have a huge collection of Pok√©mon cards,
        and the durability of these is more than enough for peace of mind. These top loaders can get
        pricey so it‚Äôs nice to see an option to buy them in bulk at a half decent price. You could
        easily load two cards that are both in Penny sleeves in this if you want, but I choose to do
        just one card per sleeve.</text>

      <text>The photos make it clear what to expect with this storage box. I've loaded mine with
        various types of cards, including thicker ones like memorabilia cards with jersey or bat
        pieces, as well as autograph cards. The padding offers solid protection for the cards, and
        the overall case feels sturdy. Although the top drawer occasionally sticks a bit when
        closing, it's not enough to warrant a lower rating. There's a slight disconnect in the liner
        of the top door, but it doesn't greatly impact the functionality. While it may not be the
        ultimate organizational tool, it serves excellently for safe, long-term storage. The design
        stands out among a saturated market for card storage solutions. Its uniqueness is a strong
        selling point. The inclusion of white gloves was a nice touch, although not particularly
        necessary. Overall, a five-star investment. I bought this storage box specifically for my
        Magic the Gathering card collection. My intention was to enhance organization and storage.
        This box exceeded my expectations in terms of size‚Äîit's larger than anticipated. The padded
        drawers offer excellent protection, each with a divider and stylish pull handles. While the
        top drawer is slightly challenging to close, I hope it eases with use. The inclusion of
        white gloves was a bit baffling, though. I've managed to fit quite a substantial number of
        cards in it, even when sleeved, which is a fantastic feature. The pricing is reasonable for
        what it offers. For anyone into Trading Card Games, this makes a fantastic gift. I've set it
        up on my desk as a practical solution for storing smaller items that I regularly use but
        don't want lying around. It's a well-built set of drawers with padded interiors and
        adjustable dividers. The ease of changing the drawer pulls without any assembly needed was a
        bonus. The only drawback might be the slightly higher price point, which has held me back
        from buying more. Overall, a solid investment for organization aficionados.</text>

      <text>This drawer set is very well made, study, heavy and high quality. It has foam on the
        inside to hold the toploaders in place so they don't jostle around.</text>

      <text>I bought this card storage box, because I have a lot of Magic the Gathering cards. I
        wanted a better organization system, and a better way to store them. When I saw this box, I
        thought I would give it a go. This storage box is bigger than I was expecting. It has nice
        padded drawers to keep my cards protected. Each drawer has 1 divider. The pull handles are
        very nice. The main box seems solidly built, but the top drawer is a little hard to close. I
        am hoping after some use it gets easier to close. It also came with white gloves, that I
        have no idea what they are for lol. I don't know how many cards it fits exactly, but it is
        quite a bit. I can put the cards in the box when they are sleeved as well, which is awesome.
        It is also a pretty good price! This is a great gift for anybody who plays Trading Card
        Games.</text>

      <text>This seems to be aimed at a more premium level. However, the foam in mine was placed
        very haphazardly, and that means the dividers also aren't square when placed in the grooves.
        Nice drawer slides have ball bearings in them, but these are just folded metal sliding on
        each other, without any kind of grease or graphite powder, either. It looks nice from the
        outside, but opening it up, it becomes apparent it isn't a premium item. Make sure you're
        either getting a deal on this one, or find one that is truly premium.</text>

      <text>Overall: Recommended. Great drawer style storage! These are better than the suitcase
        style ones if you are looking for something that you can stack and easily access. One of the
        drawers was stuck when it arrived but I was able to get it to slide out and didn't have the
        problem again. Have used this both for jewelry and cards. Cheers!</text>

      <text>It's pretty easy to see what you're getting in the pictures. I was able to load the box
        with 35 point magnetic and screw down holders, toploaded cards and memorabilia cards that
        are thicker because they have a piece of jersey or bat. I also put some autograph cards in.
        The padding is nice and will help protect the cards. The case is sturdy. The top drawer
        hangs up just a little when being pushed in....not enough to deduct a star. The liner wasn't
        completely connected to the front of the top door, but not a huge deal. The cabinet is not
        the best organizing tool, but is great for long term, safe storage. The design is unique,
        which is nice. I haven't seen another one like it in a crowded market for card storage. The
        white gloves came with it, but doesn't add much to the package. Five stars.</text>

      <text>As an avid football fan and trading card collector, I recently had the pleasure of
        exploring the 2023 Panini Trading Cards Prestige Football Blaster Box, and I must say, it's
        an absolute touchdown in the world of trading cards! First and foremost, the variety and
        quality of cards in this blaster box are truly impressive. From rookie sensations to
        seasoned veterans, the Prestige Football collection offers a diverse lineup of players from
        across the NFL. Each card is meticulously designed with vibrant colors and captivating
        imagery, making them a joy to behold for any football enthusiast. One of the highlights of
        this blaster box is the inclusion of exclusive inserts and parallels, which add an extra
        layer of excitement to the collecting experience. Whether it's the dazzling parallels that
        shimmer in the light or the rare inserts that showcase the biggest moments in football
        history, opening each pack feels like uncovering a hidden treasure trove of collectibles.
        Furthermore, the packaging of the Prestige Football Blaster Box is sleek and sturdy,
        ensuring that the cards arrive in pristine condition and are ready to be displayed or traded
        with fellow collectors. The box itself doubles as a convenient storage solution, keeping my

      <text>Was a little worried after reading other reviews but the cards came as described on the
        front of the box. We used them for goodie bags gifts and the boys were thrilled. They
        immediately started trading with each other. Lots of fun and excitement.</text>

      <text>This is a mostly fair deal, did have the autos and rares as described. Only issue is
        cards are just put in a thin cardboard box, a few did have penny sleeves but most are not
        protected. This is unfortunate as some of the cards are damaged or maybe they were like that
        when it was put together for sale. All in all not a terrible deal just wish the cards were
        cared for better for the price.</text>

      <text>The V cards are fun, but what's really cool is getting an older card! Today we got a
        Team Rocket 1st edition Machop in pristine condition. I know it's not worth a whole lot, but
        it took me back. We got to complete a few evolutions from these also and my daughter was so
        happy to get a fairy type card, which we havents seen much of. Getting the older trainers is
        also so much fun. We will (and already have) order more from them in the future. Thanks for
        making it fun to open up packs and bring us back in time.</text>

      <text>I just recently got back into collecting after a 15 year hiatus and trust me when I say
        I‚Äôve purchased all the packs available today that are of a decent price. It‚Äôs near
        impossible to get the older packs without spending a fortune but your odds of pulling cards
        from 2014/15/16 and later are pretty high in these packs. If you think your card looks fake,
        download the app Dex and you will be able to see the comparisons first hand to ensure
        quality. I check all my cards that are sent from outside sources and these packs are going
        to stay on my ‚ÄúBuy Again‚Äù list. Happy hunting everyone!</text>

      <text>DO NOT ORDER IF YOU PLAN ON GETTING FOR A BIRTHDAY OR EVENT BECAUSE IT WILL NOT BE THERE
        BY THE TIME THAT IT SAYS IT'S GOING TO BE!!! You're going to be waiting a long LONG time to
        get your package!!! I ordered these again &amp; noticed the fast Amazon shipping is now
        gone!! @Every day I've been waiting, the arrival date has been moving further and further
        away for 2 weeks &amp; still says it's arriving in a week just like it did at the beginning!
        It's been over a month now and still says it's arriving in one week! LIES!!! &gt;=( It's
        just pok√©mon cards not top secret a radiat ed bricks of gold, it shouldn't take so long to
        ship!! Just bought my third shipment of these, &amp; just as happy as the first time I
        bought them! Essentially packs twice the size of normal pok√©mon packs &amp; from across all
        the different series. either I just had really good luck or from what I can tellach pack
        comes with a guaranteed full art and holographic and two common reverse holographics each.
        These are perfect for people who are trying to build a good deck and need a trusted budget
        buy option! They're a third party sealer but they seem very professional and their packs are
        trustable. If you want energies you'll have to buy normal boosters cuz from what I can tell
        none of these contain any energy cards. I'm going to order a couple more bundles and see
        what I get! =D</text>

      <text>My kids (9, 6 &amp;5) are just getting into Pokemon and I read a lot of reviews to try
        to find a set of used older cards to supplement the new starter sets I got for them. I‚Äôm
        glad I settled on this Amazon listing. They came professionally packaged, were all authentic
        and in great condition (almost all appeared mint or near mint quality), and were a good mix
        of older cards of various rarities. There were some duplicates, which is to be expected, but
        my kids are excited to get duplicates because that means they can try to trade those with
        friends. If you‚Äôre looking mainly for quantity for kids or beginners and don‚Äôt care about
        specific rarities or a few duplicates, this is an excellent choice that will overwhelm your
        kids with tons of cards at a very cheap price.</text>

      <text>Cards look great and all of them are there! I actually got a few completed 2 stage
        evolutionary lines which was nice. Nothing super rare and there were a few duplicates,
        however if you are actually playing the game itself this is a great way to bulk up your
        options for deck building. Cards are authentic as far as I can tell!</text>

      <text>I‚Äôm long removed from collecting, but had an itch to open some cards and see what I got.
        I‚Äôm giving these to my daughter to look at in a binder anyway, so the results didn‚Äôt really
        matter. Even still, I was shocked when the first EIGHTEEN cards I saw were the same Pokemon,
        with probably 16 of the same art and 2 alternate arts. Going through the rest of the pack,
        there were multiple pokemon with 2 copies, some with 3, and even a few with 4 or 5 copies!
        Duplicates aside, I maybe received 20 unique cards, 10 of them being the holographic ones.
        With duplicates included, maybe 40 unique cards altogether. I knew for $8/100 cards the
        selection wouldn‚Äôt be incredible, but it still seemed like a ridiculous amount of repeats in
        some cases.</text>

      <text>My 6 year old just started ‚Äúcollecting‚Äù Pok√©mon cards, and this had a lot of variety. He
        wasn‚Äôt searching for anything in particular other than just different cards, which he
        received. If you are looking for rare cards, I doubt this is the route you want to go as
        they come in a clear package and obviously have been gone through prior.</text>

      <text>I have no complaints what so ever. I‚Äôve been playing the game since 1995 but obviously
        the old cards are no longer playable. So I was looking for a lot of these recent cards. I
        know they aren‚Äôt all league ready but as someone who needs some to play recreationally these
        are great! I did get duplicates but only 6 out of 200 cards.. that‚Äôs not bad. I‚Äôm going to
        order some more!</text>

      <text>The sealed box is supposed to contain 30 packs and a character pin, but there were only
        29 packs and the pin was missing. There were lose cards like someone had opened a pack and
        threw the cards in the box, which I'm guessing is what happened since the box wasn't sealed.
        I've bought this product before and the box was sealed and the character pin wasn't missing,
        so I can only assume that the quality isn't consistent, which is frustrating.</text>

      <text>Opening the 36 packs was pretty exciting. The cards are all in Japanese, the feel of
        them are relatively nice and feels like a semi-typical trading card. The base cards had
        pretty nice art on them but seemed boring compared to the holo/foil cards. Each pack came
        with 3 base cards and 1 holo card. The ace holo/foil card is definitely a favorite. I'm not
        really sure how these are supposed to be played, especially because they're not the well
        known one piece TCG, I'm planning on framing the really nice cards to put up on the wall.</text>

      <text>I've been in the process of transitioning all of my MTG collection from 3 ring binders
        to these nicer zip up binders without rings. Binders like this are definitely a huge upgrade
        over those old 3 ring binders that have a tendency to damage your cards. This binder is
        pretty similar to all of the other ringless zip up binders I own. It holds a good amount of
        cards, but not too many. This is actually a positive for me because I'm typically trying to
        store cards in complete sets that have about 350 to 400 cards in them. One problem I've run
        into with other binders is that they actually have too MANY pages in them and I end up with
        a lot of leftover blank pages that just take up space unnecessarily. So this binder "only"
        holding 432 cards is perfect. Quality wise this seems on par with others as well. The pages
        are nice and the zipper works well. I will say the covers seem a little flimsier than some
        other binders like this that I've bought and used, but it will still work perfectly fine for
        my needs. At full price I probably wouldn't buy another of these, but currently there's also
        a $5 coupon offer and at that price I think this is a pretty solid binder.</text>

      <text>In my ongoing quest to declutter our living space from the burgeoning sprawl of Pokemon
        cards, I chanced upon this 9-pocket card binder. The mission was clear: to find a durable,
        spacious, and visually appealing storage solution for my partner's Pokemon collection. This
        binder not only met but surpassed those expectations, making it a treasured addition to our
        organizational arsenal. The binder‚Äôs capacity to house 432 cards across its 24 double-sided
        pages is nothing short of a collector's dream. It adeptly accommodates standard 2.5 x
        3.5-inch cards, ensuring a snug and secure fit for a range of card types, from MTG to
        Pokemon, encapsulated in either bare, single-sleeved, or double-sleeved protection. The
        versatility of this binder is commendable, offering a flexible storage solution that caters
        to various collector preferences without discrimination. Quality and durability are the
        cornerstones of this binder‚Äôs design. The archival-safe, premium materials promise a safe
        haven for cards, shielding them from wear, tear, and the ravages of time. The sturdy and
        reliable 9-slot binder sheets are a testament to the manufacturer's commitment to quality,
        providing peace of mind that your collection is in safe hands. Ease of use is another
        hallmark of this binder. The side-loading pockets allow for effortless insertion and removal
        of cards, a feature that mitigates the fear of damaging prized collectibles during
        organization or perusal. This user-friendly design ensures a seamless experience, making
        card management a breeze rather than a chore. Reflecting on feedback from fellow collectors,
        it's evident that this binder strikes a chord with many, offering a sleek and good-looking
        repository for rares. The zipper closure is a thoughtful touch, adding an extra layer of
        security to prevent any unwanted card escapes. While some have noted the cover's slight
        flimsiness compared to other models, it hasn't detracted from the overall utility and
        protective capability of the binder in my experience. In terms of improvements, echoing the
        sentiments of others, a more robust cover could enhance the binder's durability,
        particularly for those who frequently travel or trade. Moreover, the addition of a tab for
        easier handling when closed, along with a slightly larger zipper, could elevate the user
        experience, marking the difference between a good binder and a great one. In conclusion,
        this 9-pocket card binder serves as a robust, stylish, and practical solution for storing
        and organizing trading cards. Its thoughtful design, coupled with premium materials and
        user-friendly features, make it a worthy investment for collectors of all stripes. As for
        our household, it has successfully liberated our dining room table from the clutches of card
        clutter, for which my partner and I are immensely grateful. Would I recommend it?
        Absolutely, without a second thought.</text>

      <text>I‚Äôve always been a ‚Äú3 ringed‚Äù binder kind of guy when it came to holding my magic cards.
        Even though this binder doesn‚Äôt have the same convenience of inserting and taking out pages,
        I can see why a lot of people are using these new type of side load binder pages. The soft,
        black backing of the pages feel like they‚Äôll take good care of your cards and are not as
        rough as the clear plastic pages that I‚Äôm used to. But the thing I like the most about these
        black pages is that they make your magic cards look REALLY good; The black backing combined
        with the black borders of magic cards just creates a nice visual presentation right when you
        open up the binder to look at your collection. As for the rest of the binder, the zipper
        works well and ensures that none of your cards are gonna fall out of your binder. The
        material of the binder is smooth and feels good to the touch, very similar to your typical
        school zipper binders. Overall, this is a solid binder that you will be happy with to hold
        your cards and will make your collection even more pleasing to look at.</text>

        well-aligned, the cover is at a different quality level; tends to bend under pressure and
        could bow your collection in a stuffy backpack. It‚Äôs not as thick-skinned as brand binders.
        The pages are inconsistent - some are smooth and clear, others have ripples along the seams
        and the pocket openings are slightly loose. These undeniably hold trading cards in penny
        sleeves, but there are quality brands for the same price.</text>

      <text>What you get for the price of this binder is absolutely amazing. It's high quality and
        durable and comes with a nice premium feeling cover unlike other binders you would find at
        your local card store. However when you compare it to it's competitors it's missing a few
        features that they have which I find to be a huge life saver such as a tab for people to
        hold their binders when it's closed, as well as the zipper being slightly bigger.</text>

      <text>We got this for our son for Christmas because he has recently became obsessed with
        baseball/football/basketball cards. He was so excited with this and loves that it holds so
        many cards. It is very well made and durable. We love the design and the extra caution taken
        on how the card slots are designed to prevent cards from falling out. Would definitely
        recommend!</text>

      <text>Well, starting with the good about the binder, the pockets are a great size for ease
        putting cards in. I've bought other similar binders and sometimes the slots are just a bit
        too small and make feel like I'm really working to cram the card in, but these were smooth.
        The picture is very true to what you will be getting and the overall quality is pretty good.
        The bad (likely only for me) is that one I received had some damage to the outer part of the
        binder. I'm not sure what the inner material is made from, but seems like a reasonably rigid
        cardboard type of material and mine was pretty badly bent up in the upper right hand corner
        (the packaging looked alright, but I'm guessing maybe something was set on it in shipping?).
        It left some permanent damage and though I tried my best to bend it back into shape, the
        damage is just obvious to be frustrating but just annoying enough for me not to want to take
        out all my cards once I discovered packing it didn't "fill it out" enough to get riddle of
        the "bubble" in the front that came from being damaged, so i opted not ask for request a
        return. So overall, it seems to be very good, but if you do receive one with damage, I'd
        recommend returning it rather than attempting to see if filling it or attempting to bend the
        damage back to looking "normal" or else you might be stuck moving 1000+ cards.</text>

      <text>I recently purchased the 3 booster packs of Pok√©mon cards, and I must say, I am
        thoroughly impressed! From the packaging to the assortment of cards, everything was
        top-notch. The excitement of opening each pack was unparalleled, reminiscent of the joy of
        collecting Pok√©mon cards in my youth. The variety of cards in each pack was excellent,
        offering a mix of common, uncommon, and rare cards. I was pleasantly surprised to find a few
        holographic cards that are now the jewels of my collection. The quality of the cards is
        outstanding, with vibrant colors and detailed illustrations that bring each Pok√©mon to life.
        Moreover, the price point for these 3 booster packs is quite reasonable, considering the
        potential value of the cards you receive. It's a fantastic deal for both seasoned collectors
        and newcomers to the Pok√©mon card game. The packs also serve as a great way to bolster your
        deck if you play the game competitively. In summary, these Pok√©mon booster packs exceeded my
        expectations in every way. Whether you're looking to expand your collection, gift them to a
        Pok√©mon enthusiast, or simply relive the nostalgia of your childhood, these booster packs
        are a perfect choice. I highly recommend them to anyone interested in Pok√©mon cards. Five
        stars for sure!</text>

      <text>Well, I figured for $10, I'd take a chance and see what I got. Not knowing which cards
        or pack you'll get is half the fun anyway. I wasn't hoping for much card wise, but I was at
        least hoping to get something as far back as Black/White. I got two packs of XY Roaring
        Skies and one of XY Primal Clash - both of which I could've bought at the nearest toy store,
        so that was kinda disappointing. Out of them, the only thing of worth was a reverse rare
        Banette. So, I can't say if they're weighted or not. It might just be I had bad pulling
        luck. Might give them the benefit of the doubt and try again at a later date. 3/16/16 - I
        decided to give these sellers another try. Since I've been collecting, I've gotten into
        collecting the coins and pins you can find in some boosters and packs. So this time I
        purchased (2) Three Random Booster Packs from VGMX, which stated I would get an extra coin
        and promo/holofoil card. Foolishly, I assumed that it would be three random packs, a coin
        and a promo from varying sets or previous boosters or whatever that had already been opened
        and distributed for sale. What I got was legitimately 2 blisters, resulting in all of my
        "random" packs being Breakthrough. Seeing as it would likely cost me half as much to send
        the packages back as paying for them, I decided to just accept the fact that they weren't
        random and opened them to see what I got. I got two reverse rares out of the packs, aside
        from the holo promos that came with the blisters. Something seemed fishy, but I figured that
        you can't really weight boosters, right? 3/30/16 - Wanting to solve the mystery once and for
        all, I purchased a gram scale so that I could weight the packs I buy from different stores
        and sellers, to see which places were the safest to buy cards. I decided to give this ONE
        LAST shot. So I bought 3 packs of Three Random Boosters, nine packs total, from Swift Buy.
        They arrived today and, honestly, I'm surprised that I was as hopeful as I was. But when I
        opened it and saw that my "random" boosters were in packs of three, resulting in three packs
        of 2 XY Base Set and 1 Flashfire almost with the exact same art too, I knew I was screwed.
        Still, I wanted to be dutiful and weighed each pack. It is as follows: X/Y Base w/ Yvetal
        Art = 18.5 grams X/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.4 grams X/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.4 grams X/Y
        Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.3 grams X/Y Base w/ Blastoise Art = 18.5 grams X/Y Base w/ Venosaur
        Art = 18.4 grams Flashfire w/ Mega Charizard X art = 19.8 grams Flashfire w/ Mega Charizard
        X art = 19.7 grams Flashfire w/ Pyroar art = 19.7 grams Needless to say, after seeing those
        numbers, I was upset. So I opened them all and with EVERY SINGLE NON HOLO RARE I got, I just
        got more livid. The whole reason I bought nine was because I wanted to rule out any chance
        of my having just rotten pulling luck. With Pok√©mon cards, you are expected to get one
        EX/Ultra rare every 4 packs, MAYBE five if you have a bad day. But nine packs in one sitting
        with absolutely nothing to show for it? Statistically, it simply doesn't add up. Further, if
        you add my other two previous purchases, that's 18 BOOSTERS WITH NOTHING! Now, I'm willing
        to concede that the first time I bought from Swift Buy (when all I got was the reverse rare
        Banette), I just had bad pulling luck. And while it IS hard to weight boosters, it IS
        possible. But I chose to give VGMX the benefit of the doubt. But having bought 9 packs (for
        a total of 12) from Swift Buy with nothing but non-holo rares to show for it, I can - with
        complete confidence - tell you that there is absolutely nothing random about these packs.
        They clearly pull the best packs and then resell the duds to unsuspecting online buyers,
        probably in the hopes that an unsuspecting parent or grandparent buys them for their kids
        and will never bother to submit a complaint to Amazon. Well, Swift Buy, you aren't fooling
        me. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! And only buy from VGMX if you're looking for pin-free blisters. My
        suggestion to you is to save your money and buy at your local stores. Either that, or go to
        eBay. That's where I'll be from now on.</text>

      <text>i was surprised that it came with double sided sleeves, very impressed with their
        durability and I do love the texture of the binder, very fitting and a good thing to start
        out with but on the other hand if you fill every sleeve but binder wont be able to handle it
        but for a starter binder it is fairly nice,</text>

      <text>When it arrived it looked like it was going to be all flimsy so I set it aside for 2
        weeks. Then I started putting it together. Ease of assembly only really applies if a) you
        have electric screwdriver or b) have a monster's strength in your own hands; however, after
        borrowing a tool it got done. Once it is all together it really does the job well. It is
        sturdy and holds all of the pieces I want in it. I feel it is a good value for the money.</text>

      <text>This cabinet is pretty good considering its on a budget. My biggest complaint is that
        they didn't drill holes to make the placement of shelves more customizable and some of the
        holes for the pegs aren't lined up properly. For instance the first top shelf is perfectly
        lined up for ps1 and Dreamcast games but I cant properly line up a shelf to accommodate a
        2nd shelf below it to hold my ps1 games. There's a nice big gap for shelf two that doesn't
        have the same quality as the first top shelf for storing ps1 games because the holes aren't
        lined up to do so. When you're building it can feel a bit iffy and wobbly until you complete
        it with the backboard then it becomes a lot more sturdy just be careful when you put it
        together so you don't pull the screws out accidentally lol Overall its a pretty solid budget
        option, I'll buy more of these and hope they improve on the design in the future. Whoever is
        in charge of this product should take Q&amp;A from gamers as I can tell most people who buys
        these are gaming collectors. So for anyone who is buying this to store their game collection
        its going to be like this per shelf most likely for you. Top shelf PS1,Dreamcast or 3DS/DS
        games, 2nd shelf weirdly gapped storage for the same as the top shelf but you will stack
        them horizontally instead of vertically like the top shelf, 3rd shelf will be good for blu
        ray sized cases such as ps3,ps4 and xbox one/series x games. 4th and 5th shelf good for DVD
        sized cases such as og xbox/xbox 360 and ps2 games. 5th shelf for switch games although will
        fit a little tight and also you could stack more cd sized cases like ps1 or dreamcast
        horizontally again. bottom shelf will have the most headroom which is annoying because it
        feels like a waste of space due to the inefficient design but will hold more og xbox /xbox
        360 cases and perhaps some type of sealed collectors edition box instead. Overall it does a
        decent job for the price, just wish it was a bit more sturdy and the design was more
        efficient. ordered 2 of these and will most likely order a third when I need more storage
        for my collection. Bottom line if you're looking for storage on a budget these are pretty
        good to go with, they dont look half bad either. Just know there are some quirks that comes
        with it.</text>

      <text>When I unpacked it everything looked great but that was the first impression. It was
        well packed. The problems started when I assembled it. The dowels were loose in the holes
        and did not provide much support so I glued them even though there was no instruction to do
        so. There are some metal pegs that connect with circular fittings that lock with a quarter
        turn, one of these broke when I locked it, but I thought well maybe just one bad one. I
        noticed that none of these locked well because they were poor quality. However I persevered
        and completed the carcase thinking it would be ok and did seem reasonably sturdy when I got
        the back installed. When I installed the shelves however was when I decided this was going
        to be returned. The shelf pins were a sloppy fit in the holes and the holes were not aligned
        correctly when they were drilled so the shelves wobbled real bad, as much as 3/8 inch on
        some of them. I have bought self assembly furniture in the past from Amazon and it has been
        good quality and great when assembled, but this item I would not even have given one star if
        I could have given a zero. I disassembled it and it will be returned. What a waste of
        time!!!</text>

      <text>Unit requires small ‚Äúcam locks‚Äù for proper assembly, but many of mine were cracked and
        unusable (see photo). I contacted the manufacturer and they promptly sent out a replacement
        set of hardware, but that took 13 days to arrive, meaning I was stuck with half-finished,
        unusable shelves sitting in my living room for nearly two weeks. What‚Äôs more, assembly
        proved somewhat difficult. I‚Äôm really good at assembling kit furniture and have successfully
        built IKEA pieces many times. But this unit was a troublesome build; inverting the unit to
        nail in its backing pieces was tricky, as the main pieces wanted to ‚Äúcome apart‚Äù when this
        was done. Ultimately I managed to get it done, but it wasn‚Äôt easy!</text>

      <text>I just assumed what I ordered would be a pack of cards in a box. Not at all what I
        expected. These cards came in a bag and every single card was in its own case. This is a
        Christmas gift for my son and he is going to love it! Definitely recommend this purchase for
        anyone who has a child into football and cards.</text>

      <text>I know nothing about football cards. Upon recommendation from a friend, I purchased this
        as a gift for my nephew hoping they were a good value for the money. The delight and
        excitement on my nephew's face as he went through the deck was priceless. The box lived up
        to its promise of "auto or relics". Very pleased with this purchase! I feel like I got two
        things for the price of one....the product and the satisfaction of giving a gift that was so
        well received.</text>

      <text>Cards were sorted by team and only had about 15 teams in total. My son is a Steelers fan
        and there were no Steelers cards. The autos were passed players who never even played. And
        the majority of the card were pro set cards from the 90s that your local card shop will give
        away for free. STAY AWAY! Feel bad I got this as a Christmas present</text>

        need to protect cards I turn to these. They are super easy to use, they are easy to open,
        the card slides in nicely, and it feels very nice and protected. The sleeve also goes into a
        top loader very easily as well. Highly recommend to use these to anyone.</text>

      <text>I recently purchased the Ultra PRO 3'' x 4'' Clear Regular Top Loaders for my baseball
        card collection, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed! These top loaders are exactly
        what any collector would want to keep their cards in pristine condition. The clarity of the
        plastic is top-notch, allowing me to view my cards without taking them out and risking
        damage. The size is perfect for standard baseball cards, providing a snug fit that prevents
        the cards from moving around inside. What I appreciate most is the durability of these top
        loaders. They feel sturdy and are thick enough to protect the cards from bending or
        creasing. Despite their sturdiness, they're not bulky, which makes storing and displaying my
        collection easy and convenient. Another great feature is the ease of use. Sliding cards in
        and out of the top loaders is a breeze, which is a big plus when I'm sorting or showing my
        collection to friends. I've used other brands in the past, but these are by far the most
        user-friendly. The Ultra PRO 3'' x 4'' Clear Regular Top Loaders are a fantastic investment
        for any baseball card collector. They offer the perfect blend of clarity, protection, and
        convenience. Highly recommended for keeping your cherished collection safe and in mint
        condition!</text>

      <text>Great value you get penny sleeves and top loaders that fit sport and trading card game
        cards. Clarity is good but may want to also invest in some team bags because the top loaders
        will eventually get scratched. Better the top loader gets scratched then the card.</text>

      <text>I bought these to store my Pok√©mon cards. these will do a fantastic job with protecting
        them. However‚Ä¶they have small nicks and scratches on them. There is also small dust
        particles that stick easily to them. They will not do any damage to the card since I use
        penny sleeves as well. These just don‚Äôt have a clean and nice look-</text>

      <text>The Ultra Pro Card Saver 100 pack is the best card savers on the market. They came quick

      <text>My wrestling officianado loves the cards! We bought with a card storage box and card
        protectors. I like these because they are cheaper and easier to store than the billion
        figures he has. Also if he gets duplicates he can share with his friends.</text>

      <text>We got these football cards for our nephew for Christmas and he was thrilled with them.
        There was lots of cards in this pack. Many of the cards our nephew did not have so that made
        him happy. The cards were filled with vibrant pictures of players from many different teams.
        This pack is a great price for the amount of cards you get.</text>

      <text>The cards were ok. Bought them for my grandson and he liked them. Panini offered several
        different types or bundles including former players, celebrations, etc. Very limited stats
        and info on the back. I much prefer the cards of the 60s, 70s. And no gum these days. But as
        I said he liked them so mission accomplished.</text>

      <text>These are perfectly sized for cards but could be used for anything. They are fairly thin
        cardboard, but sturdy once put together, which is a simple process. The outside is not the
        typical matte white but a glossier surface. On the plus side, this looks great, and marker
        stands out really well if you want to write labels directly onto your boxes. While the
        marker is wet it is super easy to smear, but once the marker had dried a minute or two, I
        could no longer smear it or remove it by rubbing with a dry (or damp) paper towel. The NEAT
        thing tho is that, with a spritz of isopropyl alcohol the permanent marker came off easily.
        So you can treat the surface of these boxes like a dry erase board, almost. The other nice
        thing with these boxes was the inclusion of a few colored dividers for your cards. I also
        use a block of foam to take up any empty space in each box, and if I add more cards later I
        can just trim the foam down to accommodate. All in all I'm impressed with the thought that
        went into these. I wish more storage/organization boxes had the "dry erase" type surface
        like these do.</text>

      <text>Card storage boxes from established brands like BCW Supplies use a thicker cardboard
        with their boxes. This offering from Sunezlgo goes with a thinner cardboard though. I've
        tried other boxes with this thinner cardboard, but have had issues with sections slipping
        and moving too much to be of much use. In those instances I would end up having to use tape
        to secure the box . Thankfully with these boxes, I didn't have to resort to that. As
        mentioned the cardboard is of the thinner variety, but it looks to be holding steady with my
        testing. There is some slippage, but it's not nearly as bad as I thought it might be. In
        fact I would go as far as to say that this offering is probably one of the better boxes I've
        tried using a thinner cardboard. Assembly is easy and pretty much anyone can put it
        together; first timer or trading card veteran. The spacing in this box is concerning to me.
        I was easily able to fit toploaders into this box as well as packs of sleeves (photos 5 and
        6). The top closed with very little resistance. I also tried putting stacks of cards inside
        and that was where I grew concerned. Even standard sized Pokemon and Magic the Gathering
        cards moved around far too much to the point where if jostled, they could get damaged.
        Yugioh size cards were even worse. I looked over the product page and nowhere does it say
        this box was made specifically for toploaders so it baffled me that they would market this
        as being for loose cards when it seems to work so much better for toploaders. Over all, the
        boxes hold together well enough, but not so well that I'd use these to potentially ship
        cards in. These were never meant to be used for shipping so I'm not using that against them,
        and I only mention this because I have seen several instances where people use boxes like
        these for such a thing. If you are looking to store loose cards, there are better options
        out there where the cards don't move around as much. If you are looking to store cards while
        in toploaders, this box should actually work really well.</text>

      <text>These boxes are easy and intuitive to fold, and they are very sturdy, just as their
        description claims. The outer surface has a bit of gloss to it, so it's not as easy to write
        on, and there is a bit of an odd smell to them, which I hope will dissipate in time. They
        fit my Pokemon cards, with or without penny sleeves, easily, with about a quarter inch of
        extra space between the top of the card and the side of the box. It doesn't accommodate top
        loaders because they are too wide, and you will not be able to close the lid.</text>

      <text>Unfortunately, these boxes will only fit toploaded cards which is not stated in the
        listing. If you put unsleeved cards inside, they just flop over. (For size reference, I
        collect Pokemon cards). The deviders it comes with also just flop over. Good quality boxes,
        just wish it had stated in the listing that these are for toploaders.</text>

      <text>These are a good value at about $1 per box. The cardboard material is both stiffer and
        thinner than most standard boxes. As such, I'm not sure how well I'd trust it for shipping
        cards unless the box was in a padded mailer, or another box (with postal prices today
        though, do people even ship cars in bulk anymore???). I'll be using these for storing both
        my cards and my sons Pokemon cards, and for that they'll be great.</text>

      <text>You'll notice the satin finish to the outside white cardboard exterior upon opening the
        box. I haven't seen that before. All my old boxes were just an uncoated cardboard. These
        boxes are pretty ridged as well. The fold marks are easy to bend. The box feels really solid
        when made. They include some thin plastic dividers as well. I am very happy with these.</text>

      <text>For the price the product is alright. The cards are nice with autos jersey cards and
        rookies, however every single card is no one. All players that were drafted 7-8 years ago
        didn‚Äôt play much and retired after a season or two or was released from teams because they
        weren‚Äôt good. I didn‚Äôt expect big name players by any means but at least ONE out of the five
        that are still even playing in the league would have been nice</text>

      <text>I ordered knowing there was a chance of running into stack packs due to the reviews but
        all three of my packs were factory sealed upon inspection. Opened all three packs and pulled
        a Secret Rare and Double Rare in one pack! Was excited about that. To be understood, booster
        packs are random but the value of mine came out to more than what I paid so I consider it a
        good purchase if you enjoy collecting the cards or get a thrill off ripping packs.</text>

      <text>I recently purchased the Ultra PRO Clear Card Sleeves for Standard Size Trading Cards,
        and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with their quality and affordability. These card
        sleeves have proven to be an excellent low-cost solution for protecting my precious baseball
        card collection. The sleeves are made from a durable and crystal-clear material that allows
        me to admire the cards' details while providing a strong layer of protection against dust,
        dirt, and minor scratches. They fit standard size trading cards perfectly, ensuring a snug
        and secure fit. What sets these card sleeves apart is their incredible value for the price.
        The pack contains a generous quantity of sleeves, making it a cost-effective option for
        collectors with large card collections. Despite the affordability, the sleeves don't
        compromise on quality. I appreciate how easy it is to slide the cards into the sleeves
        without any issues, and the sleeves' transparency allows me to easily identify and organize
        my cards without removing them from the protection. Overall, the Ultra PRO Clear Card
        Sleeves have exceeded my expectations, providing excellent protection and value for my
        baseball card collection.</text>

      <text>My local stores were charging around $3 for a pack of 100 clear sleeves, and they
        weren't even that good quality. These are great quality, cheaper than most alternatives, and
        they are very clear. They do not obscure the appearance of the card like some modern sleeves
        tend to do. Great at preventing scratches that build up on the surface of the cards from
        regular wear and tear. While not necessarily the best sleeves for deckbuilding (they can
        easily slip out of your hand if you have too big of a stack), these are great for cards
        going into the card binder or being slipped into a toploader. Great bang for your buck!
        Cannot recommend enough!</text>

      <text>I use these to store my Pokemon cards, both ones being stored and ones in decks I'm
        testing out. They're inexpensive and easy to sleeve, which helps me make sure I sleeve all
        of my cards before storing. Given that, they're also a very, very tad loose. Very, very
        rarely I'll have a card slip out a fraction if playing a game with them, or maybe you can
        see a bit of the proxy peeking out if playing with proxy cards backed by real cards (just be
        careful loading them though and it's not a problem). At times they kind of stick to each
        other or my hands. But they are the best sleeves ever for mash shuffling. My premium sleeves
        can't compare. These are perfect for plain ol storage or playing with (though if it's an
        expensive deck, maybe other sleeves would be better).</text>

      <text>These sleeves are great for protecting your cards. They easily fit most card sizes. We
        use them for Pokemon cards and they are quite a bit bigger than the Pokemon cards. The nice
        thing about this is that it‚Äôs easier to slip the cards into them and not worry about
        chipping the edges or bending them. They also fit into top loaders perfectly. The downside
        is that if you want to put them in those magnetic ‚Äúone touch‚Äù 35 point hard cases, these
        will be too big. But that is not why I‚Äôm deducting a star. As shown in the pictures I
        uploaded, there were 20+ sleeves that were melted during production. I consider these
        unusable and had to toss them. Overall, you get 500 sleeves for pretty cheap, so throwing
        away a few isn‚Äôt the biggest deal, but can‚Äôt give 5 stars when it‚Äôs nowhere near a perfect
        package.</text>

      <text>Normally I make my own blank ATC's from nice heavyweight paper, but having had a hectic
        week where I was very limited on time, I bought these for the convenience for a group art
        project for a young artists' club. All of the children had different ways of creatively
        utilizing these cards with the different mediums provided (watercolors, markers, pens, ink
        and stamps, glue sticks, collage material, crayons, glitter glue) and these smooth blank
        cards held up well and had no bleed-through from MODERATE marker use, but the heavier-handed
        kids that used marker did have some (bleed-through) on the back. These hold watercolors well
        also, but if there is a lot of wet-on-wet methods used, there is a slight warping. Although
        it is cheaper to make your own, if you are in a "time pinch"--these are pretty nice for what
        they are and I would not hesitate buying them again if needed.</text>

      <text>These booster packs are totally worth the wait for shipping and buying! I remember
        having my mother buy them for me as a kid. Totally relived my childhood and loved opening
        them. Even my mother joined in and opened some with me lol. I bought series 1,2, and 3 on
        amazon. I did have a couple of the boxes only have 35 packs instead of 36 but, that can be a
        simple manufacturing issue. It is still totally worth unboxing and putting them in your
        lovely binders, for that mint condition experience. Duplicates can be played with as it is a
        trading card game to test your nostalgia of Webkinz world!</text>

        one pet from it!! Lots of other cute furnitures and foods from the other codes, and the card
        game looks like its a fun little experience. I'd absolutely suggest these!</text>

      <text>The box came with 36 playing card packages. Each package came with 1 featured code card
        (some cards contained multiple codes). None of the codes were previously used. I did not get
        an animal with any of my codes but did get about 5K in KinzCash and many many items.
        Overall, it was worth it to me and will be ordering more.</text>

      <text>Ok so honest review this was really fun to open and you get 36 card packs with 6 cards
        per pack so a little over 200 cards. I got tons of furniture items some rare and some are
        stuff you can get from the W shop. There were some duplicate codes but mostly you got a fair
        selection of rare mech. There was one pet code which wasn't a rare pet but still fun to
        adopt and i depends on the pack you get. I got about 67 duplicate cards with about 4-5
        duplicate codes. However you can trade your duplicate cards and send the gifts to friends or
        give them to your other pets. So in all I do recommend this.</text>

        Dalmatian to my Webkinz family, my brother and I named him David Spade lmao, if you're still
        a fan of Webkinz and still play the code cards still 100% work!</text>

      <text>I got this Booster Box for about $8. This box came with the promised 2 legendary
        duelist, season three packs ( each one with 15 common cards and 3 ultra rare cards ), 1
        secret rare ( out of the possible 10 secret variant‚Äôs that can come in a box ) and 1 of the
        several collectible dice. The last two things I listed and can seen the pictures of
        provided. As someone who started to get back into collecting, I can say that I‚Äôm pretty
        happy with the cards that I received. And any box/set/pack or even card lot, what you get
        can depend heavily on RNG/luck. The few archetypes that I received the most cards in were
        Labrynth and Crystal beast ( again your box will differ ).</text>

      <text>If you‚Äôre looking for a great gift for your niece or nephew I can tell you that this was
        a hit! The sheets on the inside are 2x2 and have a deciding sheet between the front and back
        sides. This means that the cards don‚Äôt scratch themselves like they often can be when you
        push two into each pocket like I was used to from when i was a kid. The cover of the binder
        is great fun and has Luffy in gear 5th which comes in the manga around chapter 1050. That
        being said it is important to know that so you don‚Äôt spoil any thing for those who have not
        been keeping up with the manga or anime. The inside of the binder has three rings which can
        be a subject of contention as rings tend to pose a threat to keeping cards head and
        pristine. Lastly, I noticed that we could not fill all the pages provided with cards and
        still be able to close the binder easily without bending the cards on the inside. If you are
        a kid up to date on the story this is great.</text>

      <text>I wanted to share my review of the seller I purchased this product from. The Pokemon
        Trick or Trade Booster Bundle are great and the cards are the quality you would expect no
        matter who you get them from. I needed these for my Halloween bags to give out to the 100+
        kids that come to my house trick or treating. I ended up rushing last minute to order these
        and was worried about getting them in time to put them in the bags. I first started to place
        my order with the seller that said I would have it next day, but as I went to complete the
        check out it suddenly said between 10/31-11/4. That obviously wasn't going to work. I went
        back and did not want to overpay to get it on time so I looked at Top Choice Games. They had
        it priced reasonably and said delivery by the 30th. Now they are a new seller on Amazon with
        no feedback yet, but I put my faith in them and was not disappointed. I had them first thing
        in the morning on the 30th. They shipped it immediately after I purchased. They were packed
        well and arrived in excellent condition. Thank you so much! All of the kids thank you!
        Pokemon Halloween card packs is the best idea for trick or treating yet! And I've done it
        all! The kids loved them, even the big kids!</text>

      <text>Handing out Pok√©mon card packs on Halloween was a thrilling departure from the typical
        candy offerings, and it ignited sheer excitement among the young trick-or-treaters. As I
        distributed the packs, their eyes lit up with joy, and their gratitude was palpable. The
        kids cherished this unique Halloween treat, and it was evident in their enthusiastic
        thank-yous and beaming smiles. The true beauty of this gesture was that it provided not only
        a fun, distinctive Halloween experience but also a chance for these budding Pok√©mon
        enthusiasts to grow their collections. Many couldn't wait to rip open the packs to reveal
        new Pok√©mon and abilities, and some even started trading cards right on my doorstep. The
        sense of camaraderie that Pok√©mon brings, spanning generations, was truly heartwarming.
        Moreover, it's worth noting that Pok√©mon cards have a certain intrinsic value. They are not
        just novelties but can also hold substantial monetary worth, especially for rare or highly
        sought-after cards. This added element of value made the Halloween experience even more
        exciting for both the kids and their parents. In summary, giving out Pok√©mon card packs on
        Halloween brought joy, surprise, and a sense of community to the holiday. The kids left with
        smiles, carrying a piece of the Pok√©mon world in their hands, and perhaps even a valuable
        card that would further fuel their passion for the beloved franchise. It was a unique and
        memorable way to celebrate Halloween, embracing the magic of giving and the timeless allure
        of Pok√©mon.</text>

      <text>I bought this to give out for my daughter's 3rd grade class for Halloween - I let her
        and her sister keep all the rest (which meant they got almost 30 packs to share). There were
        duplicates, of course, but they still ended up with a lot of variety. The very last pack she
        opened finally had a Pikachu and she was super happy about that. If you are an avid
        collector you might not find what you are looking for, but for kids who just like the cute
        Halloween themed cards - it makes for a great Halloween give away or prizes.</text>

      <text>The media could not be loaded. I bought 2 of these for my sons‚Äô Pok√©mon cards and they
        are keepers! I previously bought a different binder that held less cards for more money but
        the pages inside were cloudy and kind of beat up so I returned them. These pages are crystal
        clear and seem to be high quality. The 3 rings are tight so pages won‚Äôt fall out but easy
        enough to open with one hand. The red and white binder has a crease on the front cover that
        shows up but it doesn‚Äôt bother me. My boys will put these to the test over time so I will
        update if they fall apart.</text>

      <text>I love this card holder, it's the perfect color combo for holding pokemon cards. It's
        not branded for Pokemon, but who can mistake the color combo? The feel of it is nice, it's a
        great, portable size, and it zips closed to secure any cards in case they fall out, and to
        keep the elements away from my collection. There is a nice, sturdy hand strap as well that
        can be used with a carabiner to attach to a backpack or just used to carry it around. This
        set comes with 50 sleeves, that when full will take up the entire binder. The sleeves
        themselves, and the holder, are not 8.5 x 11 binder sized (those hold 9 per side), they are
        smaller and each sleeve will carry 8 cards total, 4 on each side. The pockets are oversized
        and pokemon cards float around a bit in them. I assume this is to handle cards of varying
        sizes, so it's definitely nice that there is a zippered closure to keep loose cards from
        falling out. This certainly can't hold all of my cards, but the real use for this is to hold
        sets that you're going to use when playing the game. For that purpose, the size is perfect!
        The sleeve material feels a bit thin, so I do worry about how well they will last when
        taking cards in and out frequently. The material on my full size binder sleeves are much
        thicker. I suppose if they wear out, I'll need to look for replacements. This holder does
        look great, it's a good size for traveling, and I like the zippered closure, so I definitely
        recommend this for any pokemon card gaming fans out there!</text>

      <text>Got this for my son's growing Pok√©mon card collection. He loves it &amp; can't wait to
        fill it up! The pages hold 4 cards (though I'm sure you could double them up - I'm not sure
        why you would want to) &amp; are easy to install. The binder is a great size &amp; helps
        keep them organized.</text>

      <text>This is a useful small binder to store your favorite trading cards or to bring them to a
        friend's house. The sleeves are double-sided so each plastic sheet holds eight cards. It can
        hold them sleeved or unsleeved. You can also put several cards in each compartment if you
        want to. When I held the binder upside-down, no cards fell out which was great! It also has
        a zippered closure so you won't lose any cards. This is a well-made binder you can get lots
        of use out of! It's great for any card collector.</text>

      <text>The cards were awesome! Great variety of old and newer cards! My son and I were very
        pleased! However, one of my autograph cards was damaged inside the box. No big deal but
        definitely something to keep in mind as a purchase.</text>

      <text>This set was disappointing. They give you 5 good cards and the rest are from the throw
        aways that they don‚Äôt want or couldn‚Äôt sell. This was the worst money I‚Äôve ever spent on my
        kid. Scam!!</text>

        long story short the box looked like it was resealed and every pack also looked resealed. It

      <text>Buy with caution - our last order of 4 arrived already opened. The plastic around them
        was taped closed and we didn‚Äôt even notice until we opened the first box and ALL of the foil
        packs were opened and only base cards were left. All 4 packs were like this. We did order a
        few other times and had no issues though.</text>

      <text>These baseball cards were a huge hit with my Grandsons (age 9 and 6) on Christmas
        morning. I had no idea they would be such a great gift as I ordered them just for a stocking
        stuffer type gift. They loved them, compared them, put them in their special binders, even
        had a small tiff over them when one got put in the wrong binder. I forget what they cost but
        they were worth every penny.</text>

      <text>I purchased these cards to go in the goodie bags for my 10 year old's birthday party and
        they were a huge hit. 16 individual packs each with 16 cards in it in every box. Sometimes
        the cards are just cheep boring cards, but these had some great players that had the kids
        trading cards for HOURS after the party.</text>

      <text>These are great for dinosaur lovers. They are all different and are FULL of cool
        dinosaur facts and information. They are difficult for younger kids to read but that was
        just because of the bigger words. They have awesome pictures in full color. My kid is really
        rough on stuff and he did bend some of the cards while looking through them because they are
        the thickness of a playing card. The cards are good quality though. They also come in a cool
        tin with a dinosaur on it. These would make a nice gift!</text>

      <text>This IKRUZZI 168 card set was a huge hit for our 4 year old dinosaur enthusiast; even
        sparked the interest of a 33 year old past trading card aficionado family member. These
        cards are well made with a slick finish, holographic foil type effect and smooth edges. It
        seems the set is modeled after past Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon type cards showing strengths,
        weaknesses, battle points (attack and defense/ carnivore vs herbivore), rarity‚Ä¶all of these
        features are used when turning this set into a game. Our four year turns it also into
        charades by acting out the dinosaur card he chooses ‚Äì of course most of us can‚Äôt guess some
        of the uncommon species. With this pack including 168 different types, there are a majority
        that we are unfamiliar with. We are required to read the loads of facts on each card which
        isn‚Äôt necessarily fun for other members of the family, but our four year old is absorbing so
        much information. He uses the nice storage bin to keep them in and to transport them to
        share with others outside the family. Unless he outgrows his interests in dinosaurs, I
        foresee this set as being useful for many years to come.</text>

      <text>My 5 year old has been obsessed with dinosaurs since he saw them at a museum and in the
        movies. He pretty much can name any dinosaur you show him and he has a huge dinosaur figure
        collection. So when I saw these I had to get them for him as a Christmas gift. They come in
        a storage tin which I think is a nice presentation. He enjoyed looking through the cards at
        each dinosaur and we had fun going over the cool facts on each one. Definitely a fun
        activity to use these with a child. I also like how these can be passed on to kids of all
        ages. They aren‚Äôt too childlike or whimsical.</text>

      <text>This is a fun set. My 9 year old loves to go through the cards and tells me what they
        are. There are a very great amount of cards and the box to keep them in is cute. The cards
        and nice and thick have held up well to a lot of sorting and playing.</text>

      <text>Super easy Christmas activity for littles. Had put all cards out in a 5x5 arrangement
        and had the kids go back and forth drafting (nfl style) which cards they wanted. It was a
        hit and no one actually wanted to trade cards after because they all got what they wanted.</text>

      <text>I got this collection for my son for Christmas he absolutely loved them but when I told
        him they were holographic he corrected me and told me they were just reverses not
        holographic cards. He is a Pokemon connoisseur, so he would know. Maybe advertise
        differently next time.</text>

      <text>I'm satisfied with this little set of cards which contained 4 holos and 21 reverse
        holos. I didn't receive anything spectacular (nor did I expect to) but I didn't receive any
        duds or repeats either. Based on the description, I got pretty much exactly what I expected.
        I wouldn't recommend this for any serious collectors looking for rare cards but it's great
        for kids and beginners looking to bulk up their collections with something a little more
        interesting than standard commons. That said, I think the image in the listing is a bit
        deceptive. Some of the cards they show are extremely rare cards from early series and almost
        none of them are reverse holos which is inconsistent with the product description and the
        cards in the box. I'd suggest going by the product description rather than the picture -
        it's more accurate.</text>

      <text>I saw these and immediately had to order them.. my daughter and nephew are BIG in
        Pok√©mon and my brothers have been since they first hit the scene. So we have accumulated
        quite the card collection. THIS pack was actually pretty impressive. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to
        expect but after opening I realized that they were all pretty awesome cards. Some regular
        hologram and others were like the reverse holo cards. But every card we got was some type of
        holo card! All of them are in great shape and other than 2 cards, they were all ones we
        didn‚Äôt have already. So it is a great assortment of cards and perfect addition to any
        Pok√©mon card collection. I think for the price- it is a great value and would also be an
        awesome gift for a Pok√©mon lover!</text>

      <text>When buying these, you are paying mostly for the mystery, as the surprise can be quite
        fun in and of itself. I do expect mystery boxes to hold some amount of value though, and
        this one wasn't good, but not bad either in that regard. About average or slightly below
        that. If you really love holo cards though, this is going to be better. There were no
        duplicates, some were scuffed, but most in good shape. Most were reverse holos, and all were
        authentic Pok√©mon cards. This would be better as a gift for kids, or someone who is new to
        the game and doesn't have many cards yet. If I bought all the cards I got as singles, they
        would have cost me four bucks and thirty nine cents. Not really a great value. I got one
        trainer card, all others were pokemon. Some were as inexpensive as one to three cents. I
        doubt you are getting any of the very expensive cards they show in the pictures.</text>

      <text>I got these for my kids, and they enjoyed the mix of cards they got. I don't think these
        are necessarily super-rare cards, but they are better than the common cards you usually get
        from packs. My kids are happy, so I'm happy. That said, I don't feel these would be good as
        a gift. The box is pretty generic, so it wouldn't be obvious what they are. For an everyday
        surprise, though, they were still fun for the kids to get out and enjoy!</text>

      <text>I got these as a gift for my niece and nephew. They both very much enjoyed going through
        the cards to see what they got in the pack so for that, it was worth it. The cards came in
        good condition, and were packaged well enough. I will point out, the listing title says 'no
        duplicates' and the listing photo also says 'no duplicates ever.' You look further down in
        the listing, and they say 'near 0% duplicates.' Well, being limited to 25 cards, I figured
        they'd manage to give you zero duplicates, especially with how much they advertise no
        duplicates but it was not the case for me. It's not a huge deal for me as I was gifting
        these to two people, and they happily split the duplicates, but if you were giving these to
        a single person, that's a bit of a bummer. I may have left my Pokemon card collecting days
        behind me but I am familiar with them enough to know, the value of the pack I received is
        actually pretty good. At the current price of $19.99, you will likely receive 25 cards that
        will have a value higher than that price. Overall, these are a nice gift and I am satisfied
        with them.</text>

      <text>Great deck of Pok√©mon cards! I got this set for my 11 year old son who has been
        collecting since he was 5. He was so happy with this deck. It came with all reverse holos
        and there were no duplicates which was nice. All the cards were in perfect shape and
        packaged well. Luckily he doesn't have any of the cards from this deck, so all were new for
        him. He even got a few of his favorite Pokemon too. Overall very satisfied and would
        recommend.</text>

      <text>I recently started collecting baseball and football players cards and this one comes as
        a boon. I am impressed by the price of the card set as well as the services by the seller.
        Its so good to see different Kris Bryant cards that are in great shape. Each one is in its
        own plastic case and a hard cover to ensure protection. I can't wait to order more for my
        friend who is a fan of Kris. Great price and product. I received this product in exchange of
        my honest review and getting this product was fun.</text>

      <text>These are perfectly sized for cards but could be used for anything. They are fairly thin
        cardboard, but sturdy once put together, which is a simple process. The outside is not the
        typical matte white but a glossier surface. On the plus side, this looks great, and marker
        stands out really well if you want to write labels directly onto your boxes. While the
        marker is wet it is super easy to smear, but once the marker had dried a minute or two, I
        could no longer smear it or remove it by rubbing with a dry (or damp) paper towel. The NEAT
        thing tho is that, with a spritz of isopropyl alcohol the permanent marker came off easily.
        So you can treat the surface of these boxes like a dry erase board, almost. The other nice
        thing with these boxes was the inclusion of a few colored dividers for your cards. I also
        use a block of foam to take up any empty space in each box, and if I add more cards later I
        can just trim the foam down to accommodate. All in all I'm impressed with the thought that
        went into these. I wish more storage/organization boxes had the "dry erase" type surface
        like these do.</text>

      <text>Card storage boxes from established brands like BCW Supplies use a thicker cardboard
        with their boxes. This offering from Sunezlgo goes with a thinner cardboard though. I've
        tried other boxes with this thinner cardboard, but have had issues with sections slipping
        and moving too much to be of much use. In those instances I would end up having to use tape
        to secure the box . Thankfully with these boxes, I didn't have to resort to that. As
        mentioned the cardboard is of the thinner variety, but it looks to be holding steady with my
        testing. There is some slippage, but it's not nearly as bad as I thought it might be. In
        fact I would go as far as to say that this offering is probably one of the better boxes I've
        tried using a thinner cardboard. Assembly is easy and pretty much anyone can put it
        together; first timer or trading card veteran. The spacing in this box is concerning to me.
        I was easily able to fit toploaders into this box as well as packs of sleeves (photos 5 and
        6). The top closed with very little resistance. I also tried putting stacks of cards inside
        and that was where I grew concerned. Even standard sized Pokemon and Magic the Gathering
        cards moved around far too much to the point where if jostled, they could get damaged.
        Yugioh size cards were even worse. I looked over the product page and nowhere does it say
        this box was made specifically for toploaders so it baffled me that they would market this
        as being for loose cards when it seems to work so much better for toploaders. Over all, the
        boxes hold together well enough, but not so well that I'd use these to potentially ship
        cards in. These were never meant to be used for shipping so I'm not using that against them,
        and I only mention this because I have seen several instances where people use boxes like
        these for such a thing. If you are looking to store loose cards, there are better options
        out there where the cards don't move around as much. If you are looking to store cards while
        in toploaders, this box should actually work really well.</text>

      <text>These boxes are easy and intuitive to fold, and they are very sturdy, just as their
        description claims. The outer surface has a bit of gloss to it, so it's not as easy to write
        on, and there is a bit of an odd smell to them, which I hope will dissipate in time. They
        fit my Pokemon cards, with or without penny sleeves, easily, with about a quarter inch of
        extra space between the top of the card and the side of the box. It doesn't accommodate top
        loaders because they are too wide, and you will not be able to close the lid.</text>

      <text>Unfortunately, these boxes will only fit toploaded cards which is not stated in the
        listing. If you put unsleeved cards inside, they just flop over. (For size reference, I
        collect Pokemon cards). The deviders it comes with also just flop over. Good quality boxes,
        just wish it had stated in the listing that these are for toploaders.</text>

      <text>These are a good value at about $1 per box. The cardboard material is both stiffer and
        thinner than most standard boxes. As such, I'm not sure how well I'd trust it for shipping
        cards unless the box was in a padded mailer, or another box (with postal prices today
        though, do people even ship cars in bulk anymore???). I'll be using these for storing both
        my cards and my sons Pokemon cards, and for that they'll be great.</text>

      <text>You'll notice the satin finish to the outside white cardboard exterior upon opening the
        box. I haven't seen that before. All my old boxes were just an uncoated cardboard. These
        boxes are pretty ridged as well. The fold marks are easy to bend. The box feels really solid
        when made. They include some thin plastic dividers as well. I am very happy with these.</text>

      <text>I‚Äôm building a collection of Pok√©mon cards to be able to trade with my 6 year old
        grandson. It‚Äôs so much fun. We‚Äôre learning how to play the game,too. I ordered these hoping
        to build my trading set. They are awesome. Many cards over 100 power. Only 1 duplicate. I‚Äôll
        be ordering another set today and will report back. Hope the next is as much fun as the
        first. Starting collect? Go ahead and buy. It‚Äôs fun. These are good.</text>

      <text>For the clueless parents and grandparents out there, you won't b able to play the game
        with one purchase of these cards or even 10 sets of these cards. You'd need to get a Starter
        Set first. But if your kids already have a Starter Set this is a good value. Considering the
        playing instructions suggest that you should place four Basic, three Stage 1 and two Stage 2
        cards for each full evolution line of these pocket monsters into your Playing Deck, this is
        a good value to build up your lower ranks. Whoever designed this game was brilliant, not
        only do you "gotta get them all" but you gotta get multiples of each. Truly a money making
        business model. Doubtful you will find any Stage2 in this purchase. My purchase included: 33
        Basic Cards 11 Stage One cards 2 Energy Cards 4 Item/Supporter cards Not a bad value. The
        cards were all in good condition.</text>

      <text>I recently purchased the Pokemon TCG: Random Cards from Every Series, 50 Cards in Each
        Lot, and my experience falls in the middle ground, warranting a three-star review. Here's a
        breakdown of my observations: **Pros:** 1. **Variety in Series:** The promise of cards from
        every series is delivered upon. I appreciated the diverse mix of cards, spanning various
        generations of Pokemon, which added an element of nostalgia and excitement. 2. **Quantity in
        Each Lot:** The inclusion of 50 cards in each lot offers a decent quantity for collectors or
        players looking to expand their collection without breaking the bank. It provides a good
        starting point for those who enjoy the surprise element of random cards. 3. **Potential for
        Rare Finds:** The randomness of the cards introduces an element of surprise, and there's a
        chance of discovering rare or holographic cards. This unpredictability adds a layer of
        thrill to each lot. **Cons:** 1. **Condition Discrepancies:** While some cards were in
        excellent condition, there were noticeable discrepancies in the conditions of others. A few
        cards showed signs of wear, including creases and frayed edges, which was disappointing for
        collectors aiming for pristine cards. 2. **Limited Playability:** For those who are not
        solely collectors but also players, the random assortment may result in a lack of synergy or
        playability in constructing decks. It's a gamble whether the cards received will contribute
        meaningfully to one's gameplay strategy. 3. **Potential for Duplicates:** In my experience,
        there were instances of receiving duplicate cards within the same lot. While duplicates are
        common in randomized sets, the frequency was higher than expected and diminished the
        excitement of discovery. 4. **Lack of Packaging Information:** The cards arrived without
        specific information on the packaging regarding the series or sets included. This made it
        challenging to identify the origin of certain cards, particularly for collectors who
        appreciate categorization. 5. **No Guarantee of Rare Cards:** While the potential for rare
        finds is mentioned as a pro, the flip side is the lack of a guarantee. Some lots may not
        contain any exceptionally rare or valuable cards, which could be a letdown for those hoping
        for standout additions to their collection. In summary, the Pokemon TCG: Random Cards from
        Every Series, 50 Cards in Each Lot, offers a mixed experience. The variety and quantity are
        commendable, but the condition discrepancies, playability challenges, and the potential for
        duplicates create a somewhat unpredictable and inconsistent outcome. It's a suitable option
        for collectors seeking a diverse assortment but may leave some players or enthusiasts
        wanting more consistency and value.</text>

      <text>It should say NO RARES AT ALL in the top description paragraphs, not on one line all the
        way down the page. (Feb 2024). Apparently somebody does get a rare once in a while. Some
        people get TONS of duplicates. or even ONLY COMMONS. What the Kid gifted this got, and
        enjoyed: 13 Uncommons 38 Commons Total = 51 0 Rares 0 Holos / Foils / Reverses / Full Arts 0
        Trainer cards 0 Stage 2's Overall: Decent mix of colors nice to see a couple stage 1's that
        evolve from included basics. Good mix of what was there however, completed a couple of basic
        / stage 1 evo lines the kid only had the other half. I think there was maybe 1 duplicate.
        From the reviews however, I would consider this pack "lucky", or at least not "unlucky".
        Happy Kid, happy gifter, and having sometimes played tcg/ccg it did seem like good for what
        it was. I'd say if don't want to be guaranteed evo blocks, and you don't get this thing in
        the "unlucky" form, it's good for 4 bucks. Obviously you're overcharged for these cards at
        singles prices, but someone assembling it and shipping it is going to cost something folks,
        let's keep it real. Value is "as expected" ( BUT ONLY AFTER reading the fine print and
        realizing I got something with ZERO rares, that's why I'm docking a star. SAY IT AT THE TOP
        PLEASE, LIKE THIS ISN'T AN INJECTION, DON'T HIDE THE TRUTH)</text>

        was exactly as expected and seems it will hold up nice. The cards are easy to insert and
        remove and stay protected. I would definitely purchase again.</text>

      <text>We got this for our son for Christmas because he has recently became obsessed with
        baseball/football/basketball cards. He was so excited with this and loves that it holds so
        many cards. It is very well made and durable. We love the design and the extra caution taken
        on how the card slots are designed to prevent cards from falling out. Would definitely
        recommend!</text>

      <text>Well, starting with the good about the binder, the pockets are a great size for ease
        putting cards in. I've bought other similar binders and sometimes the slots are just a bit
        too small and make feel like I'm really working to cram the card in, but these were smooth.
        The picture is very true to what you will be getting and the overall quality is pretty good.
        The bad (likely only for me) is that one I received had some damage to the outer part of the
        binder. I'm not sure what the inner material is made from, but seems like a reasonably rigid
        cardboard type of material and mine was pretty badly bent up in the upper right hand corner
        (the packaging looked alright, but I'm guessing maybe something was set on it in shipping?).
        It left some permanent damage and though I tried my best to bend it back into shape, the
        damage is just obvious to be frustrating but just annoying enough for me not to want to take
        out all my cards once I discovered packing it didn't "fill it out" enough to get riddle of
        the "bubble" in the front that came from being damaged, so i opted not ask for request a
        return. So overall, it seems to be very good, but if you do receive one with damage, I'd
        recommend returning it rather than attempting to see if filling it or attempting to bend the
        damage back to looking "normal" or else you might be stuck moving 1000+ cards.</text>

      <text>I had fun opening this pack. Lots of variety in cards and there were a lot of
        basic/stage 1 evolution chains included. It seems like the people putting these together
        actually care about the experience for the person buying/opening the pack. Only 2 duplicates
        (I like duplicates for the deck building, but a lot of reviewers don‚Äôt like that with other
        sellers). I‚Äôm about to buy a few more and hope for the same result!</text>

      <text>Most of the cards were good but one of the four packs I ordered came with the edge bent
        on about half the pack. I assume from the way it looked, someone forced the cards into the
        box. Worst of all the half that got bent included the foil cards.</text>

      <text>When it arrived it looked like it was going to be all flimsy so I set it aside for 2
        weeks. Then I started putting it together. Ease of assembly only really applies if a) you
        have electric screwdriver or b) have a monster's strength in your own hands; however, after
        borrowing a tool it got done. Once it is all together it really does the job well. It is
        sturdy and holds all of the pieces I want in it. I feel it is a good value for the money.</text>

      <text>This cabinet is pretty good considering its on a budget. My biggest complaint is that
        they didn't drill holes to make the placement of shelves more customizable and some of the
        holes for the pegs aren't lined up properly. For instance the first top shelf is perfectly
        lined up for ps1 and Dreamcast games but I cant properly line up a shelf to accommodate a
        2nd shelf below it to hold my ps1 games. There's a nice big gap for shelf two that doesn't
        have the same quality as the first top shelf for storing ps1 games because the holes aren't
        lined up to do so. When you're building it can feel a bit iffy and wobbly until you complete
        it with the backboard then it becomes a lot more sturdy just be careful when you put it
        together so you don't pull the screws out accidentally lol Overall its a pretty solid budget
        option, I'll buy more of these and hope they improve on the design in the future. Whoever is
        in charge of this product should take Q&amp;A from gamers as I can tell most people who buys
        these are gaming collectors. So for anyone who is buying this to store their game collection
        its going to be like this per shelf most likely for you. Top shelf PS1,Dreamcast or 3DS/DS
        games, 2nd shelf weirdly gapped storage for the same as the top shelf but you will stack
        them horizontally instead of vertically like the top shelf, 3rd shelf will be good for blu
        ray sized cases such as ps3,ps4 and xbox one/series x games. 4th and 5th shelf good for DVD
        sized cases such as og xbox/xbox 360 and ps2 games. 5th shelf for switch games although will
        fit a little tight and also you could stack more cd sized cases like ps1 or dreamcast
        horizontally again. bottom shelf will have the most headroom which is annoying because it
        feels like a waste of space due to the inefficient design but will hold more og xbox /xbox
        360 cases and perhaps some type of sealed collectors edition box instead. Overall it does a
        decent job for the price, just wish it was a bit more sturdy and the design was more
        efficient. ordered 2 of these and will most likely order a third when I need more storage
        for my collection. Bottom line if you're looking for storage on a budget these are pretty
        good to go with, they dont look half bad either. Just know there are some quirks that comes
        with it.</text>

      <text>When I unpacked it everything looked great but that was the first impression. It was
        well packed. The problems started when I assembled it. The dowels were loose in the holes
        and did not provide much support so I glued them even though there was no instruction to do
        so. There are some metal pegs that connect with circular fittings that lock with a quarter
        turn, one of these broke when I locked it, but I thought well maybe just one bad one. I
        noticed that none of these locked well because they were poor quality. However I persevered
        and completed the carcase thinking it would be ok and did seem reasonably sturdy when I got
        the back installed. When I installed the shelves however was when I decided this was going
        to be returned. The shelf pins were a sloppy fit in the holes and the holes were not aligned
        correctly when they were drilled so the shelves wobbled real bad, as much as 3/8 inch on
        some of them. I have bought self assembly furniture in the past from Amazon and it has been
        good quality and great when assembled, but this item I would not even have given one star if
        I could have given a zero. I disassembled it and it will be returned. What a waste of
        time!!!</text>

      <text>Unit requires small ‚Äúcam locks‚Äù for proper assembly, but many of mine were cracked and
        unusable (see photo). I contacted the manufacturer and they promptly sent out a replacement
        set of hardware, but that took 13 days to arrive, meaning I was stuck with half-finished,
        unusable shelves sitting in my living room for nearly two weeks. What‚Äôs more, assembly
        proved somewhat difficult. I‚Äôm really good at assembling kit furniture and have successfully
        built IKEA pieces many times. But this unit was a troublesome build; inverting the unit to
        nail in its backing pieces was tricky, as the main pieces wanted to ‚Äúcome apart‚Äù when this
        was done. Ultimately I managed to get it done, but it wasn‚Äôt easy!</text>

        Panini Prizm box today. Supposed to be 6 packs with 4 cards/pack. Each sealed pack only had
        TWO cards/pack (with three having a ‚ÄòKid Reporter‚Äô card). All were veteran base cards with
        absolutely zero randomly inserted blaster exclusive cards. Only received 12 of promised 24
        cards. Extremely disappointed with Panini.</text>

        ones, but I wasn't too impressed untill my last rip I ended getting Rashee Rice RC Rookie

      <text>This is a mostly fair deal, did have the autos and rares as described. Only issue is
        cards are just put in a thin cardboard box, a few did have penny sleeves but most are not
        protected. This is unfortunate as some of the cards are damaged or maybe they were like that
        when it was put together for sale. All in all not a terrible deal just wish the cards were
        cared for better for the price.</text>

        were so many well known players! Fun!</text>

      <text>This was a gift for my nephew this Christmas. He was stoked with all the cards that were
        in there. Some of the signed ones the rookies he kept finding made his night. He had an
        amazing time opening it and can‚Äôt wait until this product is back up. Definitely be ordering
        again when available .</text>

      <text>My kids (9, 6 &amp;5) are just getting into Pokemon and I read a lot of reviews to try
        to find a set of used older cards to supplement the new starter sets I got for them. I‚Äôm
        glad I settled on this Amazon listing. They came professionally packaged, were all authentic
        and in great condition (almost all appeared mint or near mint quality), and were a good mix
        of older cards of various rarities. There were some duplicates, which is to be expected, but
        my kids are excited to get duplicates because that means they can try to trade those with
        friends. If you‚Äôre looking mainly for quantity for kids or beginners and don‚Äôt care about
        specific rarities or a few duplicates, this is an excellent choice that will overwhelm your
        kids with tons of cards at a very cheap price.</text>

      <text>Cards look great and all of them are there! I actually got a few completed 2 stage
        evolutionary lines which was nice. Nothing super rare and there were a few duplicates,
        however if you are actually playing the game itself this is a great way to bulk up your
        options for deck building. Cards are authentic as far as I can tell!</text>

      <text>I‚Äôm long removed from collecting, but had an itch to open some cards and see what I got.
        I‚Äôm giving these to my daughter to look at in a binder anyway, so the results didn‚Äôt really
        matter. Even still, I was shocked when the first EIGHTEEN cards I saw were the same Pokemon,
        with probably 16 of the same art and 2 alternate arts. Going through the rest of the pack,
        there were multiple pokemon with 2 copies, some with 3, and even a few with 4 or 5 copies!
        Duplicates aside, I maybe received 20 unique cards, 10 of them being the holographic ones.
        With duplicates included, maybe 40 unique cards altogether. I knew for $8/100 cards the
        selection wouldn‚Äôt be incredible, but it still seemed like a ridiculous amount of repeats in
        some cases.</text>

      <text>My 6 year old just started ‚Äúcollecting‚Äù Pok√©mon cards, and this had a lot of variety. He
        wasn‚Äôt searching for anything in particular other than just different cards, which he
        received. If you are looking for rare cards, I doubt this is the route you want to go as
        they come in a clear package and obviously have been gone through prior.</text>

      <text>I have no complaints what so ever. I‚Äôve been playing the game since 1995 but obviously
        the old cards are no longer playable. So I was looking for a lot of these recent cards. I
        know they aren‚Äôt all league ready but as someone who needs some to play recreationally these
        are great! I did get duplicates but only 6 out of 200 cards.. that‚Äôs not bad. I‚Äôm going to
        order some more!</text>

      <text>I have shipped countless cards , card breaks &amp; sports cards lots online . These do
        in fact fit in team bags . I prefer to use SGC graded card bags . The best thing about this
        product is that you can now safely send single or double sports cards taped to 1 or even 2
        of these dent defenders.It‚Äôs thin enough to allow you to utilize eBay‚Äôs $1 shipping with a
        tracking number ( saves lots of money over Bmwt ) . These also have a little flexibility and
        that slight bend means they usps doesn‚Äôt destroy your product putting plain envelopes into
        their sorters . This is crucial for customer retention .The price point beats the
        competition and these guys ship FAST . It‚Äôs been a long time since I left a review but it‚Äôs
        been a long time since a purchase truly exceeded my expectations ! Bravo Dent Defender !</text>

      <text>My son asked for these for Christmas. He put his Pokemon cards in them. These were a
        really good brand, they have seemed to hold up very well. We have not had any problems with
        them. They came in a timely manner, they were wrapped good and all in all they have been
        exactly what we were looking for.</text>

      <text>They are nice but I had about 15 per box that were stuck together from what appears to
        be excess heat during manufacturing. They had to be cracked open to be able to put in a
        card. This left a few marks on the inside of the toploader which I did not like so they were
        discarded. Overall this is a mediocre purchase. Thanks</text>

      <text>If you‚Äôre a fan of the anime go ahead and get these. They look amazing, you get some
        doubles but it‚Äôs not like you would with a pre set deck. These are boosters‚Ä¶they bring 3-4

      <text>The sealed box is supposed to contain 30 packs and a character pin, but there were only
        29 packs and the pin was missing. There were lose cards like someone had opened a pack and
        threw the cards in the box, which I'm guessing is what happened since the box wasn't sealed.
        I've bought this product before and the box was sealed and the character pin wasn't missing,
        so I can only assume that the quality isn't consistent, which is frustrating.</text>

      <text>Opening the 36 packs was pretty exciting. The cards are all in Japanese, the feel of
        them are relatively nice and feels like a semi-typical trading card. The base cards had
        pretty nice art on them but seemed boring compared to the holo/foil cards. Each pack came
        with 3 base cards and 1 holo card. The ace holo/foil card is definitely a favorite. I'm not
        really sure how these are supposed to be played, especially because they're not the well
        known one piece TCG, I'm planning on framing the really nice cards to put up on the wall.</text>

      <text>The quest to liberate our dining room table from an ever-expanding collection of Pokemon
        cards led me to discover this sophisticated 9-pocket card binder. Designed with both
        aesthetics and functionality in mind, it promised to be more than just a storage solution‚Äîit
        aimed to provide a sanctuary for treasured cards. After putting it to use, I‚Äôm ready to
        share my thoughts on whether it lives up to that promise. Constructed from a combination of
        waterproof EVA foam and premium PU leather, this binder exudes a business-like elegance that
        belies its protective nature. The meticulous stitching and workmanship are apparent upon
        first inspection, signaling that this is no ordinary card holder. It's a fortress for your
        cards, designed to shield them from dust, moisture, and the unintended creases and tears of
        time. Portability is a key feature, with a lightweight design that doesn‚Äôt compromise on
        protection. The durable zipper ensures that contents remain secure, while the side-loading
        pockets provide an added layer of defense against accidental falls. Moreover, the waterproof
        surface coating not only makes it safe for cards but also simplifies cleaning, a thoughtful
        touch for those who treasure cleanliness as much as collection. Boasting a huge capacity to
        store up to 288 cards, this binder turns the challenge of organizing a vast collection into
        a trivial task. The full-view display storage space, coupled with 16 transparent plastic
        pages, offers a grand stage for cards to be showcased. Whether it's a gleaming holographic
        or a cherished starter Pokemon, each card is given the respect it deserves. Specifications
        of the binder are well-considered, designed to accommodate 3'' x 4'' top loaders with ease.
        The pocket size is generously calculated to ensure a snug fit without risking damage when
        inserting or removing cards. This attention to detail is commendable and shows a deep
        understanding of collectors' needs. This card binder is a versatile sanctuary, compatible
        with an array of collectible cards beyond my partner's Pokemon obsession. From Yu-Gi-Oh to
        MTG and even sports cards, its design caters to a broad spectrum of collectors. The
        transparent sleeves are a revelation, offering sturdy, acid-free protection that prevents
        bending, fading, and staining. In practice, this binder has proved invaluable. While
        awaiting the arrival of top loaders for my partner‚Äôs collection, the binder has already
        begun to transform our dining area from a card-cluttered chaos to a realm of organized,
        accessible beauty. Its capacity and protective features make it an indispensable tool for
        any serious collector or anyone looking to display their collection with pride. In summary,
        this premium 9-pocket card binder is a masterclass in card storage solutions. Marrying form
        with function, it provides a secure, stylish home for valuable collections. Its high
        capacity and robust protection capabilities stand out, making it a worthwhile investment for
        collectors of all stripes. As we continue our journey to reclaim our dining room table, this
        binder has earned its place as a key ally. Highly recommended for anyone looking to
        safeguard and showcase their collectible cards with elegance and ease.</text>

      <text>Soo I've been doing collectible card games most of my life since the 90's. This is a
        very well designed and sturdy toploader binder. It has some weight to it. It feels robust
        and luxury. The sleeves feel well made with good binding. I've only put a few toploaders in
        it so far and only used it a bit. But I believe this binder will hold up well and is a very
        nice binder for your most prestigious cards that deserve toploaders.</text>

        sophomore cards like Deion Sanders, but other than that, most of the cards are not worth
        much. The trivia cards are pretty cool, I got two of those. I didn‚Äôt think CFL cards were a
        thing, but I did pull a couple Rocket Ismail cards. Probably not worth anything, but was
        cool to get. Over all, a great way to be nostalgic and a good kit to start for young and new
        collectors without spending a lot of money.</text>

      <text>Packs of cards are as described. The only bad thing was one of the packs of "pacific pro
        football plus" packs was missing a card. There was only 13 cards not 14.</text>

      <text>I researched a bunch of these and some say they fit top loaders but they really don‚Äôt.
        This one fit top loaders and 1-touch magnetics perfectly. The quality is amazing and the
        magnet is strong and stays in place. I‚Äôve already bought a single version of this now too
        and will be buying a few more doubles in the near future.</text>

      <text>I really like this box, I ended up buying 2 of them to store my Phillies baseball cards
        in - I may need a third soon. Toploaders fit great in there. The quality was really nice. No
        complaints so far. I didn't verify how many it holds, but it wasn't a dealbreaker for me.
        Only thing I REALLY wish for - I wish they offered a single row version of these, not just
        the double. I know other brands have them, but I just really, really liked this one.</text>

      <text>I bought one red and one blue to store my collection of baseball cards (Red for STL
        Cardinals, blue for KC Royals!). They are very sturdy, the magnetic closure is excellent,
        and - unlike many competitors who CLAIM to fit top-loaders but don't - these Yexiya storage
        boxes CAN ACTUALLY HOLD your top-loaders and one-touch cases perfectly! My blue box did
        arrive with some minor damage to one corner - The outer shipping box was in perfect
        condition, therefore someone at the Fulfillment Center must have not noticed the damage to
        that unit when they packed the order. (However it's mostly cosmetic - I kind of bent and
        massaged the sides and corner back into shape and while you can still tell it's imperfect,
        it isn't affecting closure or stacking ability, I can live with the blemish. It's not nearly
        significant enough to warrant exchanging the item.) Would love to see MORE COLOR
        COMBINATIONS to choose from!! Suggest targeting popular MLB and NFL team color combos, for
        example: Black/Purple (Rockies), Red/Yellow (Chiefs), Black/Orange (Orioles, Bengals),
        Black/Gold (Steelers, Pirates), Blue/Red (Cubs, Bills), and Blue/White (Dodgers, Colts),
        etc.</text>

      <text>This storage box is designed solely for One Touch Card Cases and that is it!!! They
        serve their purpose perfectly and I'll definitely be buying more of these in the future. If
        you're looking to store anything else I'd recommend finding the right case/tool for the job,
        otherwise don't whine when it doesn't fit whatever it is you're trying to store.</text>

      <text>Purchased this for my husband. He is using it for his one touch case cards. It‚Äôs solid
        construction and the magnetic feature is great, not to strong to cause problems opening, but
        strong enough to keep it secure. We will be purchasing more of these down the road. Great
        quality, he is very happy, even excited about how nice the box is. He has the black and red
        one. It looks sharp. Highly recommend.</text>

      <text>The media could not be loaded. I love the fact that it was at my doorstep by the next
        day and it's waterproof and to top it off the magnets hold it down and they are strong!!!
        But I wish there was a way to where we could lock it but maybe that's going to far. Lol</text>

        There was lots of cards in this pack. Many of the cards our nephew did not have so that made

        This pack is a great price for the amount of cards you get.</text>

      <text>The cards were ok. Bought them for my grandson and he liked them. Panini offered several
        different types or bundles including former players, celebrations, etc. Very limited stats
        and info on the back. I much prefer the cards of the 60s, 70s. And no gum these days. But as
        I said he liked them so mission accomplished.</text>

      <text>I recently purchased the 3 booster packs of Pok√©mon cards, and I must say, I am
        thoroughly impressed! From the packaging to the assortment of cards, everything was
        top-notch. The excitement of opening each pack was unparalleled, reminiscent of the joy of
        collecting Pok√©mon cards in my youth. The variety of cards in each pack was excellent,
        offering a mix of common, uncommon, and rare cards. I was pleasantly surprised to find a few
        holographic cards that are now the jewels of my collection. The quality of the cards is
        outstanding, with vibrant colors and detailed illustrations that bring each Pok√©mon to life.
        Moreover, the price point for these 3 booster packs is quite reasonable, considering the
        potential value of the cards you receive. It's a fantastic deal for both seasoned collectors
        and newcomers to the Pok√©mon card game. The packs also serve as a great way to bolster your
        deck if you play the game competitively. In summary, these Pok√©mon booster packs exceeded my
        expectations in every way. Whether you're looking to expand your collection, gift them to a
        Pok√©mon enthusiast, or simply relive the nostalgia of your childhood, these booster packs
        are a perfect choice. I highly recommend them to anyone interested in Pok√©mon cards. Five
        stars for sure!</text>

      <text>Well, I figured for $10, I'd take a chance and see what I got. Not knowing which cards
        or pack you'll get is half the fun anyway. I wasn't hoping for much card wise, but I was at
        least hoping to get something as far back as Black/White. I got two packs of XY Roaring
        Skies and one of XY Primal Clash - both of which I could've bought at the nearest toy store,
        so that was kinda disappointing. Out of them, the only thing of worth was a reverse rare
        Banette. So, I can't say if they're weighted or not. It might just be I had bad pulling
        luck. Might give them the benefit of the doubt and try again at a later date. 3/16/16 - I
        decided to give these sellers another try. Since I've been collecting, I've gotten into
        collecting the coins and pins you can find in some boosters and packs. So this time I
        purchased (2) Three Random Booster Packs from VGMX, which stated I would get an extra coin
        and promo/holofoil card. Foolishly, I assumed that it would be three random packs, a coin
        and a promo from varying sets or previous boosters or whatever that had already been opened
        and distributed for sale. What I got was legitimately 2 blisters, resulting in all of my
        "random" packs being Breakthrough. Seeing as it would likely cost me half as much to send
        the packages back as paying for them, I decided to just accept the fact that they weren't
        random and opened them to see what I got. I got two reverse rares out of the packs, aside
        from the holo promos that came with the blisters. Something seemed fishy, but I figured that
        you can't really weight boosters, right? 3/30/16 - Wanting to solve the mystery once and for
        all, I purchased a gram scale so that I could weight the packs I buy from different stores
        and sellers, to see which places were the safest to buy cards. I decided to give this ONE
        LAST shot. So I bought 3 packs of Three Random Boosters, nine packs total, from Swift Buy.
        They arrived today and, honestly, I'm surprised that I was as hopeful as I was. But when I
        opened it and saw that my "random" boosters were in packs of three, resulting in three packs
        of 2 XY Base Set and 1 Flashfire almost with the exact same art too, I knew I was screwed.
        Still, I wanted to be dutiful and weighed each pack. It is as follows: X/Y Base w/ Yvetal
        Art = 18.5 grams X/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.4 grams X/Y Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.4 grams X/Y
        Base w/ Yvetal Art = 18.3 grams X/Y Base w/ Blastoise Art = 18.5 grams X/Y Base w/ Venosaur
        Art = 18.4 grams Flashfire w/ Mega Charizard X art = 19.8 grams Flashfire w/ Mega Charizard
        X art = 19.7 grams Flashfire w/ Pyroar art = 19.7 grams Needless to say, after seeing those
        numbers, I was upset. So I opened them all and with EVERY SINGLE NON HOLO RARE I got, I just
        got more livid. The whole reason I bought nine was because I wanted to rule out any chance
        of my having just rotten pulling luck. With Pok√©mon cards, you are expected to get one
        EX/Ultra rare every 4 packs, MAYBE five if you have a bad day. But nine packs in one sitting
        with absolutely nothing to show for it? Statistically, it simply doesn't add up. Further, if
        you add my other two previous purchases, that's 18 BOOSTERS WITH NOTHING! Now, I'm willing
        to concede that the first time I bought from Swift Buy (when all I got was the reverse rare
        Banette), I just had bad pulling luck. And while it IS hard to weight boosters, it IS
        possible. But I chose to give VGMX the benefit of the doubt. But having bought 9 packs (for
        a total of 12) from Swift Buy with nothing but non-holo rares to show for it, I can - with
        complete confidence - tell you that there is absolutely nothing random about these packs.
        They clearly pull the best packs and then resell the duds to unsuspecting online buyers,
        probably in the hopes that an unsuspecting parent or grandparent buys them for their kids
        and will never bother to submit a complaint to Amazon. Well, Swift Buy, you aren't fooling
        me. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! And only buy from VGMX if you're looking for pin-free blisters. My
        suggestion to you is to save your money and buy at your local stores. Either that, or go to
        eBay. That's where I'll be from now on.</text>

      <text>I know nothing about football cards. Upon recommendation from a friend, I purchased this
        as a gift for my nephew hoping they were a good value for the money. The delight and
        excitement on my nephew's face as he went through the deck was priceless. The box lived up
        to its promise of "auto or relics". Very pleased with this purchase! I feel like I got two
        things for the price of one....the product and the satisfaction of giving a gift that was so
        well received.</text>

      <text>Cards were sorted by team and only had about 15 teams in total. My son is a Steelers fan
        and there were no Steelers cards. The autos were passed players who never even played. And
        the majority of the card were pro set cards from the 90s that your local card shop will give
        away for free. STAY AWAY! Feel bad I got this as a Christmas present</text>

      <text>Normally I make my own blank ATC's from nice heavyweight paper, but having had a hectic
        week where I was very limited on time, I bought these for the convenience for a group art
        project for a young artists' club. All of the children had different ways of creatively
        utilizing these cards with the different mediums provided (watercolors, markers, pens, ink
        and stamps, glue sticks, collage material, crayons, glitter glue) and these smooth blank
        cards held up well and had no bleed-through from MODERATE marker use, but the heavier-handed
        kids that used marker did have some (bleed-through) on the back. These hold watercolors well
        also, but if there is a lot of wet-on-wet methods used, there is a slight warping. Although
        it is cheaper to make your own, if you are in a "time pinch"--these are pretty nice for what
        they are and I would not hesitate buying them again if needed.</text>

      <text>Bought 4 boxes and it was well worth the price. 1 # LOTG, 2 # blue foil, 1 # gold,
        multiple rainbow foils, 1 fathers day patch card per box, rookie cards, etc. All boxes
        sealed and cards pristine. Definitely buying more ü§ôüèª</text>

      <text>This box of cards is full of random photos of rappers, kite surfing, boxers. The photo I
        took is what was in the box. One pile of cards is not baseball and the other pile is. Come
        to find out from my collector that these cards are a joke anyway.</text>

      <text>I liked the vintage style and inclusion of players such as Hank Aaron. I hate the tiny
        little cards and the stupid things like birds and instruments. It would be great if they
        didn't have the non baseball things and no tiny cards.</text>

        need to protect cards I turn to these. They are super easy to use, they are easy to open,
        the card slides in nicely, and it feels very nice and protected. The sleeve also goes into a
        top loader very easily as well. Highly recommend to use these to anyone.</text>

      <text>I love these cards! I have bought quite a few boxes and I've got some boxes better then
        others (card rarity) but overall its really nice and fun to collect. I have gotten 1 box
        that had decent damage and it did some damage to some of the cards. Most of the time they
        come great condition though.</text>

      <text>My child is into collecting squishmallows. These cards are fun and a great value. We use
        them as rewards for doing chores. We bout him a card binder so he organizes the cards by
        number. Just know that you will be receiving doubles and triples, etc, due to the large
        amount of cards in the packages combined.</text>

      <text>For the price the product is alright. The cards are nice with autos jersey cards and
        rookies, however every single card is no one. All players that were drafted 7-8 years ago
        didn‚Äôt play much and retired after a season or two or was released from teams because they
        weren‚Äôt good. I didn‚Äôt expect big name players by any means but at least ONE out of the five
        that are still even playing in the league would have been nice</text>

        BE BETTER OFF GETTING THEM OFF OF EBAY OR A CAARD STORE.</text>

      <text>Great Christmas gift for my two boys. I originally thought these were individually
        wrapped packs of 50 or so but they are not. Was a little disappointed in that as opening the
        packs is half the fun of collecting cards. We chose to break them down and wrap them into
        packs for the boys. Otherwise great card quality and selection.</text>

      <text>I recently purchased the Ultra PRO 3'' x 4'' Clear Regular Top Loaders for my baseball
        card collection, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed! These top loaders are exactly
        what any collector would want to keep their cards in pristine condition. The clarity of the
        plastic is top-notch, allowing me to view my cards without taking them out and risking
        damage. The size is perfect for standard baseball cards, providing a snug fit that prevents
        the cards from moving around inside. What I appreciate most is the durability of these top
        loaders. They feel sturdy and are thick enough to protect the cards from bending or
        creasing. Despite their sturdiness, they're not bulky, which makes storing and displaying my
        collection easy and convenient. Another great feature is the ease of use. Sliding cards in
        and out of the top loaders is a breeze, which is a big plus when I'm sorting or showing my
        collection to friends. I've used other brands in the past, but these are by far the most
        user-friendly. The Ultra PRO 3'' x 4'' Clear Regular Top Loaders are a fantastic investment
        for any baseball card collector. They offer the perfect blend of clarity, protection, and
        convenience. Highly recommended for keeping your cherished collection safe and in mint
        condition!</text>

      <text>Great value you get penny sleeves and top loaders that fit sport and trading card game
        cards. Clarity is good but may want to also invest in some team bags because the top loaders
        will eventually get scratched. Better the top loader gets scratched then the card.</text>

      <text>I bought these to store my Pok√©mon cards. these will do a fantastic job with protecting
        them. However‚Ä¶they have small nicks and scratches on them. There is also small dust
        particles that stick easily to them. They will not do any damage to the card since I use
        penny sleeves as well. These just don‚Äôt have a clean and nice look-</text>

      <text>The Ultra Pro Card Saver 100 pack is the best card savers on the market. They came quick
        and safe from Amazon like usual. I am a card collector and seller. These keep the cards
        protected at all times and never bend or break. My cards stay in mint condition like they
        should be. I highly recommend this product and for the price it is the best value you can
        get.</text>

      <text>Got these for my boys for Easter and they loved them. I think they preferred that there
        were old and new cards combined. In their words ‚Äúit‚Äôs better to have some from all eras and
        they are mostly good, instead of all new players and a lot of them aren‚Äôt that great‚Äù
        (referencing the new foil packs) there were cards we had never seen before. Highly recommend
        for any new collectors or kids who just like to be surprised. Attached is some of my son‚Äôs
        favorites from the set.</text>

      <text>These baseball cards were a huge hit with my Grandsons (age 9 and 6) on Christmas
        morning. I had no idea they would be such a great gift as I ordered them just for a stocking
        stuffer type gift. They loved them, compared them, put them in their special binders, even
        had a small tiff over them when one got put in the wrong binder. I forget what they cost but
        they were worth every penny.</text>

        was taped closed and we didn‚Äôt even notice until we opened the first box and ALL of the foil
        packs were opened and only base cards were left. All 4 packs were like this. We did order a

      <text>No complaints at all, but it might be helpful to know that the envelope itself is not
        very thick paper. Satisfactory for my use but I wouldn't send wedding invitations or fancier
        cards in them. I would opt for something that felt more "high grade". Also the color has a
        slight yellow undertone, not a true "paper bag" brown. Again, not a complaint, and most
        people probably won't see the difference, just mentioning it. Love that it came in a 60
        pack. Great value for price. I would order again.</text>

      <text>I needed these for some hand made cards because I was not able to make the envelops
        myself due to the size of the card. The envelops are a great size they came quickly and work
        well. BUT every time you life the flap the front corner rips. They are not made of good
        quality craft paper. I noticed it on the first envelop I took out so with the second and
        third I made sure to be extra careful but still had the same problem. I won‚Äôt order them
        again due to this.</text>

        baseball cards. He loves to sort and resort the cards (by team or by position or by league)
        and just admire everything in the binder. Very happy with this, and looks very cute on
        bookshelf</text>

      <text>Very pleased with card binder. Would definitely recommend if you are on the fence, maybe
        buy larger if you are a real card collector, but this will get the job done if you card
        collection is modest. Nice sleeves and solid.</text>

      <text>Fits standard top-loaders beautifully, as advertised. They fit a little loosely if the
        slot behind the filled one is empty. (If you have a slot on the front side of a page filled,
        put one on the backside to keep that one from flopping around while you transport the
        binder.) My solution to that was just to load 8 cards at a time and fill both sides of a
        page at once.</text>

      <text>The little display stands fit my needs perfectly! I recently went on vacation and bought
        little wooden surfboard magnets for my employees. After I got back though, I felt they may
        be too big/may take up a lot of space as a magnet. So I decided to give the employees the
        option of putting them on a display stand. I chose these. Although they aren‚Äôt adjustable,
        the little surfboards are able to lean on them perfectly without tipping over. For
        reference, the surfboards are about 5.5 inches tall and 1.5 inches (about .75-1 inch where
        the board meets/touches the stand. Definitely recommend for more than just coins!</text>

      <text>This product turned out to be exactly what I was hoping. The stands are large enough for
        a wide variety of coins, patches, and etc. but can also accommodate smaller things. I have
        one large coin in a plastic case that is about the maximum size the stand could accommodate,
        so this definitely works better for things that don't have cases or wrappings. But even
        still, the stands did their job with the few coins I have that do have cases. This is
        exactly what I was hoping these would turn out to be.</text>

      <text>My wrestling officianado loves the cards! We bought with a card storage box and card
        protectors. I like these because they are cheaper and easier to store than the billion
        figures he has. Also if he gets duplicates he can share with his friends.</text>

      <text>These booster packs are totally worth the wait for shipping and buying! I remember
        having my mother buy them for me as a kid. Totally relived my childhood and loved opening
        them. Even my mother joined in and opened some with me lol. I bought series 1,2, and 3 on
        amazon. I did have a couple of the boxes only have 35 packs instead of 36 but, that can be a
        simple manufacturing issue. It is still totally worth unboxing and putting them in your
        lovely binders, for that mint condition experience. Duplicates can be played with as it is a
        trading card game to test your nostalgia of Webkinz world!</text>

        one pet from it!! Lots of other cute furnitures and foods from the other codes, and the card
        game looks like its a fun little experience. I'd absolutely suggest these!</text>

      <text>The box came with 36 playing card packages. Each package came with 1 featured code card
        (some cards contained multiple codes). None of the codes were previously used. I did not get
        an animal with any of my codes but did get about 5K in KinzCash and many many items.
        Overall, it was worth it to me and will be ordering more.</text>

      <text>Ok so honest review this was really fun to open and you get 36 card packs with 6 cards
        per pack so a little over 200 cards. I got tons of furniture items some rare and some are
        stuff you can get from the W shop. There were some duplicate codes but mostly you got a fair
        selection of rare mech. There was one pet code which wasn't a rare pet but still fun to
        adopt and i depends on the pack you get. I got about 67 duplicate cards with about 4-5
        duplicate codes. However you can trade your duplicate cards and send the gifts to friends or
        give them to your other pets. So in all I do recommend this.</text>

        a fan of Webkinz and still play the code cards still 100% work!</text>

        grandson. It‚Äôs so much fun. We‚Äôre learning how to play the game,too. I ordered these hoping
        to build my trading set. They are awesome. Many cards over 100 power. Only 1 duplicate. I‚Äôll
        be ordering another set today and will report back. Hope the next is as much fun as the
        first. Starting collect? Go ahead and buy. It‚Äôs fun. These are good.</text>

      <text>For the clueless parents and grandparents out there, you won't b able to play the game
        with one purchase of these cards or even 10 sets of these cards. You'd need to get a Starter
        Set first. But if your kids already have a Starter Set this is a good value. Considering the
        playing instructions suggest that you should place four Basic, three Stage 1 and two Stage 2
        cards for each full evolution line of these pocket monsters into your Playing Deck, this is
        a good value to build up your lower ranks. Whoever designed this game was brilliant, not
        only do you "gotta get them all" but you gotta get multiples of each. Truly a money making
        business model. Doubtful you will find any Stage2 in this purchase. My purchase included: 33
        Basic Cards 11 Stage One cards 2 Energy Cards 4 Item/Supporter cards Not a bad value. The
        cards were all in good condition.</text>

      <text>I recently purchased the Pokemon TCG: Random Cards from Every Series, 50 Cards in Each
        Lot, and my experience falls in the middle ground, warranting a three-star review. Here's a
        breakdown of my observations: **Pros:** 1. **Variety in Series:** The promise of cards from
        every series is delivered upon. I appreciated the diverse mix of cards, spanning various
        generations of Pokemon, which added an element of nostalgia and excitement. 2. **Quantity in
        Each Lot:** The inclusion of 50 cards in each lot offers a decent quantity for collectors or
        players looking to expand their collection without breaking the bank. It provides a good
        starting point for those who enjoy the surprise element of random cards. 3. **Potential for
        Rare Finds:** The randomness of the cards introduces an element of surprise, and there's a
        chance of discovering rare or holographic cards. This unpredictability adds a layer of
        thrill to each lot. **Cons:** 1. **Condition Discrepancies:** While some cards were in
        excellent condition, there were noticeable discrepancies in the conditions of others. A few
        cards showed signs of wear, including creases and frayed edges, which was disappointing for
        collectors aiming for pristine cards. 2. **Limited Playability:** For those who are not
        solely collectors but also players, the random assortment may result in a lack of synergy or
        playability in constructing decks. It's a gamble whether the cards received will contribute
        meaningfully to one's gameplay strategy. 3. **Potential for Duplicates:** In my experience,
        there were instances of receiving duplicate cards within the same lot. While duplicates are
        common in randomized sets, the frequency was higher than expected and diminished the
        excitement of discovery. 4. **Lack of Packaging Information:** The cards arrived without
        specific information on the packaging regarding the series or sets included. This made it
        challenging to identify the origin of certain cards, particularly for collectors who
        appreciate categorization. 5. **No Guarantee of Rare Cards:** While the potential for rare
        finds is mentioned as a pro, the flip side is the lack of a guarantee. Some lots may not
        contain any exceptionally rare or valuable cards, which could be a letdown for those hoping
        for standout additions to their collection. In summary, the Pokemon TCG: Random Cards from
        Every Series, 50 Cards in Each Lot, offers a mixed experience. The variety and quantity are
        commendable, but the condition discrepancies, playability challenges, and the potential for
        duplicates create a somewhat unpredictable and inconsistent outcome. It's a suitable option
        for collectors seeking a diverse assortment but may leave some players or enthusiasts
        wanting more consistency and value.</text>

      <text>It should say NO RARES AT ALL in the top description paragraphs, not on one line all the
        way down the page. (Feb 2024). Apparently somebody does get a rare once in a while. Some
        people get TONS of duplicates. or even ONLY COMMONS. What the Kid gifted this got, and
        enjoyed: 13 Uncommons 38 Commons Total = 51 0 Rares 0 Holos / Foils / Reverses / Full Arts 0
        Trainer cards 0 Stage 2's Overall: Decent mix of colors nice to see a couple stage 1's that
        evolve from included basics. Good mix of what was there however, completed a couple of basic
        / stage 1 evo lines the kid only had the other half. I think there was maybe 1 duplicate.
        From the reviews however, I would consider this pack "lucky", or at least not "unlucky".
        Happy Kid, happy gifter, and having sometimes played tcg/ccg it did seem like good for what
        it was. I'd say if don't want to be guaranteed evo blocks, and you don't get this thing in
        the "unlucky" form, it's good for 4 bucks. Obviously you're overcharged for these cards at
        singles prices, but someone assembling it and shipping it is going to cost something folks,
        let's keep it real. Value is "as expected" ( BUT ONLY AFTER reading the fine print and
        realizing I got something with ZERO rares, that's why I'm docking a star. SAY IT AT THE TOP
        PLEASE, LIKE THIS ISN'T AN INJECTION, DON'T HIDE THE TRUTH)</text>

      <text>Well, starting with the good about the binder, the pockets are a great size for ease
        putting cards in. I've bought other similar binders and sometimes the slots are just a bit
        too small and make feel like I'm really working to cram the card in, but these were smooth.
        The picture is very true to what you will be getting and the overall quality is pretty good.
        The bad (likely only for me) is that one I received had some damage to the outer part of the
        binder. I'm not sure what the inner material is made from, but seems like a reasonably rigid
        cardboard type of material and mine was pretty badly bent up in the upper right hand corner
        (the packaging looked alright, but I'm guessing maybe something was set on it in shipping?).
        It left some permanent damage and though I tried my best to bend it back into shape, the
        damage is just obvious to be frustrating but just annoying enough for me not to want to take
        out all my cards once I discovered packing it didn't "fill it out" enough to get riddle of
        the "bubble" in the front that came from being damaged, so i opted not ask for request a
        return. So overall, it seems to be very good, but if you do receive one with damage, I'd
        recommend returning it rather than attempting to see if filling it or attempting to bend the
        damage back to looking "normal" or else you might be stuck moving 1000+ cards.</text>

      <text>I had fun opening this pack. Lots of variety in cards and there were a lot of
        basic/stage 1 evolution chains included. It seems like the people putting these together
        actually care about the experience for the person buying/opening the pack. Only 2 duplicates
        (I like duplicates for the deck building, but a lot of reviewers don‚Äôt like that with other
        sellers). I‚Äôm about to buy a few more and hope for the same result!</text>

      <text>Most of the cards were good but one of the four packs I ordered came with the edge bent
        on about half the pack. I assume from the way it looked, someone forced the cards into the
        box. Worst of all the half that got bent included the foil cards.</text>

      <text>When it arrived it looked like it was going to be all flimsy so I set it aside for 2
        weeks. Then I started putting it together. Ease of assembly only really applies if a) you
        have electric screwdriver or b) have a monster's strength in your own hands; however, after
        borrowing a tool it got done. Once it is all together it really does the job well. It is
        sturdy and holds all of the pieces I want in it. I feel it is a good value for the money.</text>

      <text>This media shelf is perfect if you have very little space. It only sticks out about 6‚Äù
        from the wall. It was easy to put together and secure to the wall. I love it.</text>

      <text>This cabinet is pretty good considering its on a budget. My biggest complaint is that
        they didn't drill holes to make the placement of shelves more customizable and some of the
        holes for the pegs aren't lined up properly. For instance the first top shelf is perfectly
        lined up for ps1 and Dreamcast games but I cant properly line up a shelf to accommodate a
        2nd shelf below it to hold my ps1 games. There's a nice big gap for shelf two that doesn't
        have the same quality as the first top shelf for storing ps1 games because the holes aren't
        lined up to do so. When you're building it can feel a bit iffy and wobbly until you complete
        it with the backboard then it becomes a lot more sturdy just be careful when you put it
        together so you don't pull the screws out accidentally lol Overall its a pretty solid budget
        option, I'll buy more of these and hope they improve on the design in the future. Whoever is
        in charge of this product should take Q&amp;A from gamers as I can tell most people who buys
        these are gaming collectors. So for anyone who is buying this to store their game collection
        its going to be like this per shelf most likely for you. Top shelf PS1,Dreamcast or 3DS/DS
        games, 2nd shelf weirdly gapped storage for the same as the top shelf but you will stack
        them horizontally instead of vertically like the top shelf, 3rd shelf will be good for blu
        ray sized cases such as ps3,ps4 and xbox one/series x games. 4th and 5th shelf good for DVD
        sized cases such as og xbox/xbox 360 and ps2 games. 5th shelf for switch games although will
        fit a little tight and also you could stack more cd sized cases like ps1 or dreamcast
        horizontally again. bottom shelf will have the most headroom which is annoying because it
        feels like a waste of space due to the inefficient design but will hold more og xbox /xbox
        360 cases and perhaps some type of sealed collectors edition box instead. Overall it does a
        decent job for the price, just wish it was a bit more sturdy and the design was more
        efficient. ordered 2 of these and will most likely order a third when I need more storage
        for my collection. Bottom line if you're looking for storage on a budget these are pretty
        good to go with, they dont look half bad either. Just know there are some quirks that comes
        with it.</text>

      <text>When I unpacked it everything looked great but that was the first impression. It was
        well packed. The problems started when I assembled it. The dowels were loose in the holes
        and did not provide much support so I glued them even though there was no instruction to do
        so. There are some metal pegs that connect with circular fittings that lock with a quarter
        turn, one of these broke when I locked it, but I thought well maybe just one bad one. I
        noticed that none of these locked well because they were poor quality. However I persevered
        and completed the carcase thinking it would be ok and did seem reasonably sturdy when I got
        the back installed. When I installed the shelves however was when I decided this was going
        to be returned. The shelf pins were a sloppy fit in the holes and the holes were not aligned
        correctly when they were drilled so the shelves wobbled real bad, as much as 3/8 inch on
        some of them. I have bought self assembly furniture in the past from Amazon and it has been
        good quality and great when assembled, but this item I would not even have given one star if
        I could have given a zero. I disassembled it and it will be returned. What a waste of
        time!!!</text>

      <text>Unit requires small ‚Äúcam locks‚Äù for proper assembly, but many of mine were cracked and
        unusable (see photo). I contacted the manufacturer and they promptly sent out a replacement
        set of hardware, but that took 13 days to arrive, meaning I was stuck with half-finished,
        unusable shelves sitting in my living room for nearly two weeks. What‚Äôs more, assembly
        proved somewhat difficult. I‚Äôm really good at assembling kit furniture and have successfully
        built IKEA pieces many times. But this unit was a troublesome build; inverting the unit to
        nail in its backing pieces was tricky, as the main pieces wanted to ‚Äúcome apart‚Äù when this
        was done. Ultimately I managed to get it done, but it wasn‚Äôt easy!</text>

      <text>This is a mostly fair deal, did have the autos and rares as described. Only issue is
        cards are just put in a thin cardboard box, a few did have penny sleeves but most are not
        protected. This is unfortunate as some of the cards are damaged or maybe they were like that
        when it was put together for sale. All in all not a terrible deal just wish the cards were
        cared for better for the price.</text>

      <text>I just assumed what I ordered would be a pack of cards in a box. Not at all what I
        expected. These cards came in a bag and every single card was in its own case. This is a
        Christmas gift for my son and he is going to love it! Definitely recommend this purchase for
        anyone who has a child into football and cards.</text>

      <text>I love these card protectors for shipping single or multiple cards in card saver II's I
        put 2nof these in a team bag and slide 1-3 card savers in between them and seal the team
        bag. No taping card holder or taping protectors. Everything fits in a team bag. Great for
        shipping and customers live receiving them knowing their new cars was protected. A++</text>

      <text>I have shipped countless cards , card breaks &amp; sports cards lots online . These do
        in fact fit in team bags . I prefer to use SGC graded card bags . The best thing about this
        product is that you can now safely send single or double sports cards taped to 1 or even 2
        of these dent defenders.It‚Äôs thin enough to allow you to utilize eBay‚Äôs $1 shipping with a
        tracking number ( saves lots of money over Bmwt ) . These also have a little flexibility and
        that slight bend means they usps doesn‚Äôt destroy your product putting plain envelopes into
        their sorters . This is crucial for customer retention .The price point beats the
        competition and these guys ship FAST . It‚Äôs been a long time since I left a review but it‚Äôs
        been a long time since a purchase truly exceeded my expectations ! Bravo Dent Defender !</text>

      <text>Use this to protect varying sports trading cards, raw or slabbed cards. Comes in
        different sizes and I bought both. Definitely helps and ensures your item gets delivered

        aiming to preserve their cards for the long term. The materials used are free from harmful
        acids and PVC, preventing potential damage to the cards over time. This archival-grade
        feature is especially crucial for those with rare or vintage cards, ensuring that the
        sleeves contribute to the preservation of their monetary and sentimental value. The top
        loader sleeves have proven to be versatile in accommodating different card thicknesses.

        really good brand, they have seemed to hold up very well. We have not had any problems with

        exactly what we were looking for.</text>

      <text>They are nice but I had about 15 per box that were stuck together from what appears to
        be excess heat during manufacturing. They had to be cracked open to be able to put in a
        card. This left a few marks on the inside of the toploader which I did not like so they were
        discarded. Overall this is a mediocre purchase. Thanks</text>

      <text>The quest to liberate our dining room table from an ever-expanding collection of Pokemon
        cards led me to discover this sophisticated 9-pocket card binder. Designed with both
        aesthetics and functionality in mind, it promised to be more than just a storage solution‚Äîit
        aimed to provide a sanctuary for treasured cards. After putting it to use, I‚Äôm ready to
        share my thoughts on whether it lives up to that promise. Constructed from a combination of
        waterproof EVA foam and premium PU leather, this binder exudes a business-like elegance that
        belies its protective nature. The meticulous stitching and workmanship are apparent upon
        first inspection, signaling that this is no ordinary card holder. It's a fortress for your
        cards, designed to shield them from dust, moisture, and the unintended creases and tears of
        time. Portability is a key feature, with a lightweight design that doesn‚Äôt compromise on
        protection. The durable zipper ensures that contents remain secure, while the side-loading
        pockets provide an added layer of defense against accidental falls. Moreover, the waterproof
        surface coating not only makes it safe for cards but also simplifies cleaning, a thoughtful
        touch for those who treasure cleanliness as much as collection. Boasting a huge capacity to
        store up to 288 cards, this binder turns the challenge of organizing a vast collection into
        a trivial task. The full-view display storage space, coupled with 16 transparent plastic
        pages, offers a grand stage for cards to be showcased. Whether it's a gleaming holographic
        or a cherished starter Pokemon, each card is given the respect it deserves. Specifications
        of the binder are well-considered, designed to accommodate 3'' x 4'' top loaders with ease.
        The pocket size is generously calculated to ensure a snug fit without risking damage when
        inserting or removing cards. This attention to detail is commendable and shows a deep
        understanding of collectors' needs. This card binder is a versatile sanctuary, compatible
        with an array of collectible cards beyond my partner's Pokemon obsession. From Yu-Gi-Oh to
        MTG and even sports cards, its design caters to a broad spectrum of collectors. The
        transparent sleeves are a revelation, offering sturdy, acid-free protection that prevents
        bending, fading, and staining. In practice, this binder has proved invaluable. While
        awaiting the arrival of top loaders for my partner‚Äôs collection, the binder has already
        begun to transform our dining area from a card-cluttered chaos to a realm of organized,
        accessible beauty. Its capacity and protective features make it an indispensable tool for
        any serious collector or anyone looking to display their collection with pride. In summary,
        this premium 9-pocket card binder is a masterclass in card storage solutions. Marrying form
        with function, it provides a secure, stylish home for valuable collections. Its high
        capacity and robust protection capabilities stand out, making it a worthwhile investment for
        collectors of all stripes. As we continue our journey to reclaim our dining room table, this
        binder has earned its place as a key ally. Highly recommended for anyone looking to
        safeguard and showcase their collectible cards with elegance and ease.</text>

      <text>Soo I've been doing collectible card games most of my life since the 90's. This is a
        very well designed and sturdy toploader binder. It has some weight to it. It feels robust
        and luxury. The sleeves feel well made with good binding. I've only put a few toploaders in
        it so far and only used it a bit. But I believe this binder will hold up well and is a very
        nice binder for your most prestigious cards that deserve toploaders.</text>

      <text>I researched a bunch of these and some say they fit top loaders but they really don‚Äôt.
        This one fit top loaders and 1-touch magnetics perfectly. The quality is amazing and the
        magnet is strong and stays in place. I‚Äôve already bought a single version of this now too
        and will be buying a few more doubles in the near future.</text>

      <text>I really like this box, I ended up buying 2 of them to store my Phillies baseball cards
        in - I may need a third soon. Toploaders fit great in there. The quality was really nice. No
        complaints so far. I didn't verify how many it holds, but it wasn't a dealbreaker for me.
        Only thing I REALLY wish for - I wish they offered a single row version of these, not just
        the double. I know other brands have them, but I just really, really liked this one.</text>

      <text>I bought one red and one blue to store my collection of baseball cards (Red for STL
        Cardinals, blue for KC Royals!). They are very sturdy, the magnetic closure is excellent,
        and - unlike many competitors who CLAIM to fit top-loaders but don't - these Yexiya storage
        boxes CAN ACTUALLY HOLD your top-loaders and one-touch cases perfectly! My blue box did
        arrive with some minor damage to one corner - The outer shipping box was in perfect
        condition, therefore someone at the Fulfillment Center must have not noticed the damage to
        that unit when they packed the order. (However it's mostly cosmetic - I kind of bent and
        massaged the sides and corner back into shape and while you can still tell it's imperfect,
        it isn't affecting closure or stacking ability, I can live with the blemish. It's not nearly
        significant enough to warrant exchanging the item.) Would love to see MORE COLOR
        COMBINATIONS to choose from!! Suggest targeting popular MLB and NFL team color combos, for
        example: Black/Purple (Rockies), Red/Yellow (Chiefs), Black/Orange (Orioles, Bengals),
        Black/Gold (Steelers, Pirates), Blue/Red (Cubs, Bills), and Blue/White (Dodgers, Colts),
        etc.</text>

      <text>This storage box is designed solely for One Touch Card Cases and that is it!!! They
        serve their purpose perfectly and I'll definitely be buying more of these in the future. If
        you're looking to store anything else I'd recommend finding the right case/tool for the job,
        otherwise don't whine when it doesn't fit whatever it is you're trying to store.</text>

      <text>Purchased this for my husband. He is using it for his one touch case cards. It‚Äôs solid
        construction and the magnetic feature is great, not to strong to cause problems opening, but
        strong enough to keep it secure. We will be purchasing more of these down the road. Great
        quality, he is very happy, even excited about how nice the box is. He has the black and red
        one. It looks sharp. Highly recommend.</text>

      <text>The media could not be loaded. I love the fact that it was at my doorstep by the next
        day and it's waterproof and to top it off the magnets hold it down and they are strong!!!
        But I wish there was a way to where we could lock it but maybe that's going to far. Lol</text>

      <text>These and the Beckett card sleeves for me seem to be the highest quality. Tried some
        from Aliexpress and it was just super janky and easy to damage cards. Definitely recommend
        these sleeves for the value. Pretty much a no-brainer necessary product to keep you cards
        from scratching.</text>

      <text>These are great cards for drawing on. I found that they worked perfectly with pens,
        pencils and markers. They didn't bleed through to the other side as I have experienced with
        other brands. Will definitely be purchasing these when I start drawing my comic cards again.</text>

      <text>Normally I make my own blank ATC's from nice heavyweight paper, but having had a hectic
        week where I was very limited on time, I bought these for the convenience for a group art
        project for a young artists' club. All of the children had different ways of creatively
        utilizing these cards with the different mediums provided (watercolors, markers, pens, ink
        and stamps, glue sticks, collage material, crayons, glitter glue) and these smooth blank
        cards held up well and had no bleed-through from MODERATE marker use, but the heavier-handed
        kids that used marker did have some (bleed-through) on the back. These hold watercolors well
        also, but if there is a lot of wet-on-wet methods used, there is a slight warping. Although
        it is cheaper to make your own, if you are in a "time pinch"--these are pretty nice for what
        they are and I would not hesitate buying them again if needed.</text>

      <text>I ordered knowing there was a chance of running into stack packs due to the reviews but
        all three of my packs were factory sealed upon inspection. Opened all three packs and pulled
        a Secret Rare and Double Rare in one pack! Was excited about that. To be understood, booster
        packs are random but the value of mine came out to more than what I paid so I consider it a
        good purchase if you enjoy collecting the cards or get a thrill off ripping packs.</text>

      <text>I recently purchased the Ultra PRO Clear Card Sleeves for Standard Size Trading Cards,
        and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with their quality and affordability. These card
        sleeves have proven to be an excellent low-cost solution for protecting my precious baseball
        card collection. The sleeves are made from a durable and crystal-clear material that allows
        me to admire the cards' details while providing a strong layer of protection against dust,
        dirt, and minor scratches. They fit standard size trading cards perfectly, ensuring a snug
        and secure fit. What sets these card sleeves apart is their incredible value for the price.
        The pack contains a generous quantity of sleeves, making it a cost-effective option for
        collectors with large card collections. Despite the affordability, the sleeves don't
        compromise on quality. I appreciate how easy it is to slide the cards into the sleeves
        without any issues, and the sleeves' transparency allows me to easily identify and organize
        my cards without removing them from the protection. Overall, the Ultra PRO Clear Card
        Sleeves have exceeded my expectations, providing excellent protection and value for my
        baseball card collection.</text>

      <text>My local stores were charging around $3 for a pack of 100 clear sleeves, and they
        weren't even that good quality. These are great quality, cheaper than most alternatives, and
        they are very clear. They do not obscure the appearance of the card like some modern sleeves
        tend to do. Great at preventing scratches that build up on the surface of the cards from
        regular wear and tear. While not necessarily the best sleeves for deckbuilding (they can
        easily slip out of your hand if you have too big of a stack), these are great for cards
        going into the card binder or being slipped into a toploader. Great bang for your buck!
        Cannot recommend enough!</text>

      <text>I use these to store my Pokemon cards, both ones being stored and ones in decks I'm
        testing out. They're inexpensive and easy to sleeve, which helps me make sure I sleeve all
        of my cards before storing. Given that, they're also a very, very tad loose. Very, very
        rarely I'll have a card slip out a fraction if playing a game with them, or maybe you can
        see a bit of the proxy peeking out if playing with proxy cards backed by real cards (just be
        careful loading them though and it's not a problem). At times they kind of stick to each
        other or my hands. But they are the best sleeves ever for mash shuffling. My premium sleeves
        can't compare. These are perfect for plain ol storage or playing with (though if it's an
        expensive deck, maybe other sleeves would be better).</text>

      <text>My Husband is a card collector and was very happy with these sleeves. They don‚Äôt have a
        weird smell like some of the others we‚Äôve tried and work great for what he needs!</text>

      <text>These sleeves are great for protecting your cards. They easily fit most card sizes. We
        use them for Pokemon cards and they are quite a bit bigger than the Pokemon cards. The nice
        thing about this is that it‚Äôs easier to slip the cards into them and not worry about
        chipping the edges or bending them. They also fit into top loaders perfectly. The downside
        is that if you want to put them in those magnetic ‚Äúone touch‚Äù 35 point hard cases, these
        will be too big. But that is not why I‚Äôm deducting a star. As shown in the pictures I
        uploaded, there were 20+ sleeves that were melted during production. I consider these
        unusable and had to toss them. Overall, you get 500 sleeves for pretty cheap, so throwing
        away a few isn‚Äôt the biggest deal, but can‚Äôt give 5 stars when it‚Äôs nowhere near a perfect
        package.</text>

      <text>Got these for my boys for Easter and they loved them. I think they preferred that there
        were old and new cards combined. In their words ‚Äúit‚Äôs better to have some from all eras and
        they are mostly good, instead of all new players and a lot of them aren‚Äôt that great‚Äù
        (referencing the new foil packs) there were cards we had never seen before. Highly recommend
        for any new collectors or kids who just like to be surprised. Attached is some of my son‚Äôs
        favorites from the set.</text>

      <text>No complaints at all, but it might be helpful to know that the envelope itself is not
        very thick paper. Satisfactory for my use but I wouldn't send wedding invitations or fancier
        cards in them. I would opt for something that felt more "high grade". Also the color has a
        slight yellow undertone, not a true "paper bag" brown. Again, not a complaint, and most
        people probably won't see the difference, just mentioning it. Love that it came in a 60
        pack. Great value for price. I would order again.</text>

      <text>I needed these for some hand made cards because I was not able to make the envelops
        myself due to the size of the card. The envelops are a great size they came quickly and work
        well. BUT every time you life the flap the front corner rips. They are not made of good
        quality craft paper. I noticed it on the first envelop I took out so with the second and
        third I made sure to be extra careful but still had the same problem. I won‚Äôt order them
        again due to this.</text>

      <text>Very pleased with card binder. Would definitely recommend if you are on the fence, maybe
        buy larger if you are a real card collector, but this will get the job done if you card
        collection is modest. Nice sleeves and solid.</text>

      <text>The media could not be loaded. Great binder, wonder amount of space between the bend of
        the binder and the pages so no cards would get warped over time the closer they are to the
        crease 10/10</text>

      <text>Fits standard top-loaders beautifully, as advertised. They fit a little loosely if the
        slot behind the filled one is empty. (If you have a slot on the front side of a page filled,
        put one on the backside to keep that one from flopping around while you transport the
        binder.) My solution to that was just to load 8 cards at a time and fill both sides of a
        page at once.</text>

      <text>The top loader trading card sleeves has proven to be a game-changer in safeguarding and
        enhancing the longevity of my cherished card collection. These transparent protective
        sleeves have not only exceeded my expectations in terms of durability but have also elevated
        the overall presentation of my cards, ensuring a secure haven for my most prized
        collectibles. The primary standout feature of these top loader sleeves is their robust
        construction. Crafted from sturdy and rigid materials, these sleeves offer a solid defense
        against external elements, preventing bends, creases, and other potential damage to my
        valuable trading cards. The top-loading design simplifies the insertion and removal process
        while providing an extra layer of protection for the cards. The clarity of the sleeves is
        commendable, allowing the vibrant colors and intricate details of my trading cards to shine
        through. The crystal-clear transparency ensures that each card remains easily visible and
        aesthetically pleasing, maintaining the visual appeal of my collection without compromising
        on protection. The sizing of the top loader sleeves is precise, catering to standard trading
        card dimensions. This snug fit ensures a secure enclosure, preventing any unnecessary
        movement that could lead to wear and tear. Additionally, the sleeves feature a reliable
        closure mechanism, keeping the cards firmly in place while allowing for easy access when
        needed. The archival quality of these sleeves is a significant advantage for collectors
        aiming to preserve their cards for the long term. The materials used are free from harmful
        acids and PVC, preventing potential damage to the cards over time. This archival-grade
        feature is especially crucial for those with rare or vintage cards, ensuring that the
        sleeves contribute to the preservation of their monetary and sentimental value. The top
        loader sleeves have proven to be versatile in accommodating different card thicknesses.
        Whether I'm housing standard trading cards or thicker specialty cards, these sleeves offer
        flexibility without compromising on protection. This adaptability is appreciated, allowing
        me to use the same sleeves for various cards within my collection. The purchase experience
        was seamless, with the sleeves arriving promptly and securely packaged. The user-friendly
        design of the packaging, including clear labeling and quantity information, made it easy to
        organize and store the sleeves for future use. In conclusion, the top loader trading card
        sleeves have proven to be an essential investment for any serious collector. Their robust
        construction, clarity, archival quality, and versatility make them a standout choice for
        protecting and showcasing trading card collections. If you're looking to preserve the
        integrity and visual appeal of your valuable cards, these top loader sleeves are a reliable
        and worthwhile addition to your collecting arsenal.</text>

      <text>My son asked for these for Christmas. He put his Pokemon cards in them. These were a
        really good brand, they have seemed to hold up very well. We have not had any problems with
        them. They came in a timely manner, they were wrapped good and all in all they have been
        exactly what we were looking for.</text>

      <text>They are nice but I had about 15 per box that were stuck together from what appears to
        be excess heat during manufacturing. They had to be cracked open to be able to put in a
        card. This left a few marks on the inside of the toploader which I did not like so they were
        discarded. Overall this is a mediocre purchase. Thanks</text>

      <text>We got this for our son for Christmas because he has recently became obsessed with
        baseball/football/basketball cards. He was so excited with this and loves that it holds so
        many cards. It is very well made and durable. We love the design and the extra caution taken
        on how the card slots are designed to prevent cards from falling out. Would definitely
        recommend!</text>

      <text>Well, starting with the good about the binder, the pockets are a great size for ease
        putting cards in. I've bought other similar binders and sometimes the slots are just a bit
        too small and make feel like I'm really working to cram the card in, but these were smooth.
        The picture is very true to what you will be getting and the overall quality is pretty good.
        The bad (likely only for me) is that one I received had some damage to the outer part of the
        binder. I'm not sure what the inner material is made from, but seems like a reasonably rigid
        cardboard type of material and mine was pretty badly bent up in the upper right hand corner
        (the packaging looked alright, but I'm guessing maybe something was set on it in shipping?).
        It left some permanent damage and though I tried my best to bend it back into shape, the
        damage is just obvious to be frustrating but just annoying enough for me not to want to take
        out all my cards once I discovered packing it didn't "fill it out" enough to get riddle of
        the "bubble" in the front that came from being damaged, so i opted not ask for request a
        return. So overall, it seems to be very good, but if you do receive one with damage, I'd
        recommend returning it rather than attempting to see if filling it or attempting to bend the
        damage back to looking "normal" or else you might be stuck moving 1000+ cards.</text>

      <text>I had fun opening this pack. Lots of variety in cards and there were a lot of
        basic/stage 1 evolution chains included. It seems like the people putting these together
        actually care about the experience for the person buying/opening the pack. Only 2 duplicates
        (I like duplicates for the deck building, but a lot of reviewers don‚Äôt like that with other
        sellers). I‚Äôm about to buy a few more and hope for the same result!</text>

      <text>Most of the cards were good but one of the four packs I ordered came with the edge bent
        on about half the pack. I assume from the way it looked, someone forced the cards into the
        box. Worst of all the half that got bent included the foil cards.</text>

      <text>When it arrived it looked like it was going to be all flimsy so I set it aside for 2
        weeks. Then I started putting it together. Ease of assembly only really applies if a) you
        have electric screwdriver or b) have a monster's strength in your own hands; however, after
        borrowing a tool it got done. Once it is all together it really does the job well. It is
        sturdy and holds all of the pieces I want in it. I feel it is a good value for the money.</text>

      <text>This media shelf is perfect if you have very little space. It only sticks out about 6‚Äù
        from the wall. It was easy to put together and secure to the wall. I love it.</text>

      <text>This cabinet is pretty good considering its on a budget. My biggest complaint is that
        they didn't drill holes to make the placement of shelves more customizable and some of the
        holes for the pegs aren't lined up properly. For instance the first top shelf is perfectly
        lined up for ps1 and Dreamcast games but I cant properly line up a shelf to accommodate a
        2nd shelf below it to hold my ps1 games. There's a nice big gap for shelf two that doesn't
        have the same quality as the first top shelf for storing ps1 games because the holes aren't
        lined up to do so. When you're building it can feel a bit iffy and wobbly until you complete
        it with the backboard then it becomes a lot more sturdy just be careful when you put it
        together so you don't pull the screws out accidentally lol Overall its a pretty solid budget
        option, I'll buy more of these and hope they improve on the design in the future. Whoever is
        in charge of this product should take Q&amp;A from gamers as I can tell most people who buys
        these are gaming collectors. So for anyone who is buying this to store their game collection
        its going to be like this per shelf most likely for you. Top shelf PS1,Dreamcast or 3DS/DS
        games, 2nd shelf weirdly gapped storage for the same as the top shelf but you will stack
        them horizontally instead of vertically like the top shelf, 3rd shelf will be good for blu
        ray sized cases such as ps3,ps4 and xbox one/series x games. 4th and 5th shelf good for DVD
        sized cases such as og xbox/xbox 360 and ps2 games. 5th shelf for switch games although will
        fit a little tight and also you could stack more cd sized cases like ps1 or dreamcast
        horizontally again. bottom shelf will have the most headroom which is annoying because it
        feels like a waste of space due to the inefficient design but will hold more og xbox /xbox
        360 cases and perhaps some type of sealed collectors edition box instead. Overall it does a
        decent job for the price, just wish it was a bit more sturdy and the design was more
        efficient. ordered 2 of these and will most likely order a third when I need more storage
        for my collection. Bottom line if you're looking for storage on a budget these are pretty
        good to go with, they dont look half bad either. Just know there are some quirks that comes
        with it.</text>

      <text>When I unpacked it everything looked great but that was the first impression. It was
        well packed. The problems started when I assembled it. The dowels were loose in the holes
        and did not provide much support so I glued them even though there was no instruction to do
        so. There are some metal pegs that connect with circular fittings that lock with a quarter
        turn, one of these broke when I locked it, but I thought well maybe just one bad one. I
        noticed that none of these locked well because they were poor quality. However I persevered
        and completed the carcase thinking it would be ok and did seem reasonably sturdy when I got
        the back installed. When I installed the shelves however was when I decided this was going
        to be returned. The shelf pins were a sloppy fit in the holes and the holes were not aligned
        correctly when they were drilled so the shelves wobbled real bad, as much as 3/8 inch on
        some of them. I have bought self assembly furniture in the past from Amazon and it has been
        good quality and great when assembled, but this item I would not even have given one star if
        I could have given a zero. I disassembled it and it will be returned. What a waste of
        time!!!</text>

      <text>Unit requires small ‚Äúcam locks‚Äù for proper assembly, but many of mine were cracked and
        unusable (see photo). I contacted the manufacturer and they promptly sent out a replacement
        set of hardware, but that took 13 days to arrive, meaning I was stuck with half-finished,
        unusable shelves sitting in my living room for nearly two weeks. What‚Äôs more, assembly
        proved somewhat difficult. I‚Äôm really good at assembling kit furniture and have successfully
        built IKEA pieces many times. But this unit was a troublesome build; inverting the unit to
        nail in its backing pieces was tricky, as the main pieces wanted to ‚Äúcome apart‚Äù when this
        was done. Ultimately I managed to get it done, but it wasn‚Äôt easy!</text>

      <text>I just assumed what I ordered would be a pack of cards in a box. Not at all what I
        expected. These cards came in a bag and every single card was in its own case. This is a
        Christmas gift for my son and he is going to love it! Definitely recommend this purchase for

      <text>I have shipped countless cards , card breaks &amp; sports cards lots online . These do
        in fact fit in team bags . I prefer to use SGC graded card bags . The best thing about this
        product is that you can now safely send single or double sports cards taped to 1 or even 2
        of these dent defenders.It‚Äôs thin enough to allow you to utilize eBay‚Äôs $1 shipping with a
        tracking number ( saves lots of money over Bmwt ) . These also have a little flexibility and
        that slight bend means they usps doesn‚Äôt destroy your product putting plain envelopes into
        their sorters . This is crucial for customer retention .The price point beats the
        competition and these guys ship FAST . It‚Äôs been a long time since I left a review but it‚Äôs
        been a long time since a purchase truly exceeded my expectations ! Bravo Dent Defender !</text>

      <text>They are nice but I had about 15 per box that were stuck together from what appears to
        be excess heat during manufacturing. They had to be cracked open to be able to put in a
        card. This left a few marks on the inside of the toploader which I did not like so they were
        discarded. Overall this is a mediocre purchase. Thanks</text>

      <text>Bought for my son. Very happy with the amount of sleeves that came with it for the
        price. Nice quality cases for baseball cards. Would recommend and plan to buy more when
        needed!</text>

      <text>The quest to liberate our dining room table from an ever-expanding collection of Pokemon
        cards led me to discover this sophisticated 9-pocket card binder. Designed with both
        aesthetics and functionality in mind, it promised to be more than just a storage solution‚Äîit
        aimed to provide a sanctuary for treasured cards. After putting it to use, I‚Äôm ready to
        share my thoughts on whether it lives up to that promise. Constructed from a combination of
        waterproof EVA foam and premium PU leather, this binder exudes a business-like elegance that
        belies its protective nature. The meticulous stitching and workmanship are apparent upon
        first inspection, signaling that this is no ordinary card holder. It's a fortress for your
        cards, designed to shield them from dust, moisture, and the unintended creases and tears of
        time. Portability is a key feature, with a lightweight design that doesn‚Äôt compromise on
        protection. The durable zipper ensures that contents remain secure, while the side-loading
        pockets provide an added layer of defense against accidental falls. Moreover, the waterproof
        surface coating not only makes it safe for cards but also simplifies cleaning, a thoughtful
        touch for those who treasure cleanliness as much as collection. Boasting a huge capacity to
        store up to 288 cards, this binder turns the challenge of organizing a vast collection into
        a trivial task. The full-view display storage space, coupled with 16 transparent plastic
        pages, offers a grand stage for cards to be showcased. Whether it's a gleaming holographic
        or a cherished starter Pokemon, each card is given the respect it deserves. Specifications
        of the binder are well-considered, designed to accommodate 3'' x 4'' top loaders with ease.
        The pocket size is generously calculated to ensure a snug fit without risking damage when
        inserting or removing cards. This attention to detail is commendable and shows a deep
        understanding of collectors' needs. This card binder is a versatile sanctuary, compatible
        with an array of collectible cards beyond my partner's Pokemon obsession. From Yu-Gi-Oh to
        MTG and even sports cards, its design caters to a broad spectrum of collectors. The
        transparent sleeves are a revelation, offering sturdy, acid-free protection that prevents
        bending, fading, and staining. In practice, this binder has proved invaluable. While
        awaiting the arrival of top loaders for my partner‚Äôs collection, the binder has already
        begun to transform our dining area from a card-cluttered chaos to a realm of organized,
        accessible beauty. Its capacity and protective features make it an indispensable tool for
        any serious collector or anyone looking to display their collection with pride. In summary,
        this premium 9-pocket card binder is a masterclass in card storage solutions. Marrying form
        with function, it provides a secure, stylish home for valuable collections. Its high
        capacity and robust protection capabilities stand out, making it a worthwhile investment for
        collectors of all stripes. As we continue our journey to reclaim our dining room table, this
        binder has earned its place as a key ally. Highly recommended for anyone looking to
        safeguard and showcase their collectible cards with elegance and ease.</text>

      <text>Soo I've been doing collectible card games most of my life since the 90's. This is a
        very well designed and sturdy toploader binder. It has some weight to it. It feels robust
        and luxury. The sleeves feel well made with good binding. I've only put a few toploaders in
        it so far and only used it a bit. But I believe this binder will hold up well and is a very
        nice binder for your most prestigious cards that deserve toploaders.</text>

      <text>I was excited to receive some current mlb rookies with one grade 9 and the rest grade
        10. Looked up the value and was pleasantly surprised that it was equal to what I paid. Just
        paid for another one. Probably the best deal I‚Äôve found on buying mystery pack graded cards.

      <text>This is a decent product, but I would recommend buying their 3x slabs of heat from their
        website directly. Those cards are the best bang for the buck going if you want slabbed
        cards. Bought this particular product twice and they have been hit and miss. The value isn't
        as good as their slabs of heat.</text>

        Maddux insert. Plus a bonus with a few packs of 2021 Topps Opening day and a 1998 Stadium
        Club jumbo pack, nothing of note in the packs. Barely enough to get half of what I paid. I
        wasn't expecting anything super exciting but I was hoping for something a little better than

      <text>The sealed box is supposed to contain 30 packs and a character pin, but there were only
        29 packs and the pin was missing. There were lose cards like someone had opened a pack and
        threw the cards in the box, which I'm guessing is what happened since the box wasn't sealed.
        I've bought this product before and the box was sealed and the character pin wasn't missing,
        so I can only assume that the quality isn't consistent, which is frustrating.</text>

      <text>Opening the 36 packs was pretty exciting. The cards are all in Japanese, the feel of
        them are relatively nice and feels like a semi-typical trading card. The base cards had
        pretty nice art on them but seemed boring compared to the holo/foil cards. Each pack came
        with 3 base cards and 1 holo card. The ace holo/foil card is definitely a favorite. I'm not
        really sure how these are supposed to be played, especially because they're not the well
        known one piece TCG, I'm planning on framing the really nice cards to put up on the wall.</text>

      <text>This box was a great price for such good cards. Although, when buying sports cards it
        can be risky, but I‚Äôm sure that this box will leave you satisfied. Every card I got was
        worth over $5. I will definitely buy again.</text>

      <text>I recently purchased the Ultra PRO Clear Card Sleeves for Standard Size Trading Cards,
        and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with their quality and affordability. These card
        sleeves have proven to be an excellent low-cost solution for protecting my precious baseball
        card collection. The sleeves are made from a durable and crystal-clear material that allows
        me to admire the cards' details while providing a strong layer of protection against dust,
        dirt, and minor scratches. They fit standard size trading cards perfectly, ensuring a snug
        and secure fit. What sets these card sleeves apart is their incredible value for the price.
        The pack contains a generous quantity of sleeves, making it a cost-effective option for
        collectors with large card collections. Despite the affordability, the sleeves don't
        compromise on quality. I appreciate how easy it is to slide the cards into the sleeves
        without any issues, and the sleeves' transparency allows me to easily identify and organize
        my cards without removing them from the protection. Overall, the Ultra PRO Clear Card
        Sleeves have exceeded my expectations, providing excellent protection and value for my
        baseball card collection.</text>

      <text>My local stores were charging around $3 for a pack of 100 clear sleeves, and they
        weren't even that good quality. These are great quality, cheaper than most alternatives, and
        they are very clear. They do not obscure the appearance of the card like some modern sleeves
        tend to do. Great at preventing scratches that build up on the surface of the cards from
        regular wear and tear. While not necessarily the best sleeves for deckbuilding (they can
        easily slip out of your hand if you have too big of a stack), these are great for cards
        going into the card binder or being slipped into a toploader. Great bang for your buck!
        Cannot recommend enough!</text>

      <text>I use these to store my Pokemon cards, both ones being stored and ones in decks I'm
        testing out. They're inexpensive and easy to sleeve, which helps me make sure I sleeve all
        of my cards before storing. Given that, they're also a very, very tad loose. Very, very
        rarely I'll have a card slip out a fraction if playing a game with them, or maybe you can
        see a bit of the proxy peeking out if playing with proxy cards backed by real cards (just be
        careful loading them though and it's not a problem). At times they kind of stick to each
        other or my hands. But they are the best sleeves ever for mash shuffling. My premium sleeves
        can't compare. These are perfect for plain ol storage or playing with (though if it's an
        expensive deck, maybe other sleeves would be better).</text>

      <text>These sleeves are great for protecting your cards. They easily fit most card sizes. We
        use them for Pokemon cards and they are quite a bit bigger than the Pokemon cards. The nice
        thing about this is that it‚Äôs easier to slip the cards into them and not worry about
        chipping the edges or bending them. They also fit into top loaders perfectly. The downside
        is that if you want to put them in those magnetic ‚Äúone touch‚Äù 35 point hard cases, these
        will be too big. But that is not why I‚Äôm deducting a star. As shown in the pictures I
        uploaded, there were 20+ sleeves that were melted during production. I consider these
        unusable and had to toss them. Overall, you get 500 sleeves for pretty cheap, so throwing
        away a few isn‚Äôt the biggest deal, but can‚Äôt give 5 stars when it‚Äôs nowhere near a perfect
        package.</text>

      <text>I bought these to put packs in my grandson‚Äôs Easter basket. When I opened box was
        shocked to see all three packs were open and cards missing. Two packs only had 8 cards and
        one had 10 cards. Very Disappointed and will NEVER buy again!!!!</text>

      <text>Does exactly what they‚Äôre supposed to do: holds cards. I use them for Magic the
        Gathering cards. They work great for bulk cards that don‚Äôt need a lot of care. They seem to
        be just big enough that cards would fit with standard cases too, but I don‚Äôt store bulk
        cards that way. My only gripe is the quality has been a bit inconsistent. All the boxes I‚Äôve
        received have worked, but several have had nicks and different things on the exteriors, and
        a few of them seem to have been pre-creased (so you can assembly them) kind of weird, and so
        they won‚Äôt stay together very well. Still, they work, and I‚Äôve ordered a dozen at this
        point. Can‚Äôt beat the cost for the amount of cards you can store.</text>

      <text>This is a pretty underwhelming card storage box. Assembly is easy, but the box doesn't
        hold together well. The tabs are too short, and overall, the cardboard is pretty thin and
        flimsy. I have a lot of card storage boxes, and this is the worst I've ever bought. Granted
        they're cheap at ~$5 each, and you typically get what you pay for, but these are just not
        great boxes, especially compared to the hyperbolic description the seller provides.</text>

      <text>Wanted to use these to hold a bunch of Dominion cards. Unfortunately they are low
        quality and will barely function to do so. They were not cheap either, being 14$ for three
        boxes; just very flimsy and barely hold box shape, not at all like the sturdy ones I
        remember. These barely stay shut! Avoid!</text>

      <text>Got these for my boys for Easter and they loved them. I think they preferred that there
        were old and new cards combined. In their words ‚Äúit‚Äôs better to have some from all eras and
        they are mostly good, instead of all new players and a lot of them aren‚Äôt that great‚Äù
        (referencing the new foil packs) there were cards we had never seen before. Highly recommend
        for any new collectors or kids who just like to be surprised. Attached is some of my son‚Äôs
        favorites from the set.</text>

      <text>Very pleased with card binder. Would definitely recommend if you are on the fence, maybe
        buy larger if you are a real card collector, but this will get the job done if you card
        collection is modest. Nice sleeves and solid.</text>

      <text>The media could not be loaded. Great binder, wonder amount of space between the bend of
        the binder and the pages so no cards would get warped over time the closer they are to the

      <text>Fits standard top-loaders beautifully, as advertised. They fit a little loosely if the
        slot behind the filled one is empty. (If you have a slot on the front side of a page filled,
        put one on the backside to keep that one from flopping around while you transport the
        binder.) My solution to that was just to load 8 cards at a time and fill both sides of a
        page at once.</text>

      <text>My little grandson absolutely loves to play basketball and watch basketball with his
        daddy. These NBA Ballers are one of the only brands were the little figurines really look
        like the players. They will be so much fun for him to collect. I think they would be
        appropriate for all ages, even though they are mini figures. There is great detail and
        excellent workmanship.</text>

      <text>This is a 2-pack, so a pretty good value. Nicely done images of the players for
        collectors, and also great for younger kids to actually play together. Could be really
        educational to look up the players you get and find out about their lives and careers.</text>

      <text>This was cute but not my favorite. I think it is cool for boys that are in between of
        liking some toys but also too big for toys. If your child is a huge basketball fan then this
        would be even better. My son thought it was cool and thought he really wanted but is not
        into basketball much so was not really familiar with the basketball player we got. Again a
        really good in-between toy/collectible for a bball lover.</text>

      <text>I was pleasantly surprised on how thick the plastic is. I was expecting something more
        flimsy but these are sturdy trays. You can pick up the tray with cards in it without it
        warping at the slightest movement and spilling cards out. The two pack is best bang for your
        buck on card sorters.</text>

      <text>Do not judge this product negatively by the images. It is somewhat thin plastic, but it
        is a very stronge plastic that doesn't feel cheap or brittle. Made sorting my MTG cards a
        breeze.</text>

      <text>Bought this because I wanted an easier set up to organize my bulk. Turns out it was a
        great buy. The trays are very sturdy, each slot has enough space to easily hold 100 cards,
        the fact that it comes with two trays makes the purchase even better. Can also fit a deck
        box (Ultra Pro) but unfortunately can not fit top loaders</text>

      <text>Like the title says, I received only one sorter as opposed to 2 (the description says
        it's a 2-pack). That aside, the tray is rock solid and made out of hard plastic. I see a few
        different products similar on Amazon, but they look like vacuum-formed trays that will break
        if you sneeze the wrong way. This one, however, will hold up to a lot of punishment.
        Overall, very good product but wish the description was accurate. UPDATE: Just got contacted
        by Titanshield and they were pretty darn quick in responding, which is amazing in this day
        and age. They are shipping out an extra tray, so looks like the description was
        accurate...changing this to a five star. Again, very good and solid product.</text>

      <text>I have limited space and need to sort a lot of cards, these have been a huge help in
        getting them sorted. I just wish they were cheaper because really it is just a plastic tray.</text>

      <text>The top loader trading card sleeves has proven to be a game-changer in safeguarding and
        enhancing the longevity of my cherished card collection. These transparent protective
        sleeves have not only exceeded my expectations in terms of durability but have also elevated
        the overall presentation of my cards, ensuring a secure haven for my most prized
        collectibles. The primary standout feature of these top loader sleeves is their robust
        construction. Crafted from sturdy and rigid materials, these sleeves offer a solid defense
        against external elements, preventing bends, creases, and other potential damage to my
        valuable trading cards. The top-loading design simplifies the insertion and removal process
        while providing an extra layer of protection for the cards. The clarity of the sleeves is
        commendable, allowing the vibrant colors and intricate details of my trading cards to shine
        through. The crystal-clear transparency ensures that each card remains easily visible and
        aesthetically pleasing, maintaining the visual appeal of my collection without compromising
        on protection. The sizing of the top loader sleeves is precise, catering to standard trading
        card dimensions. This snug fit ensures a secure enclosure, preventing any unnecessary
        movement that could lead to wear and tear. Additionally, the sleeves feature a reliable
        closure mechanism, keeping the cards firmly in place while allowing for easy access when
        needed. The archival quality of these sleeves is a significant advantage for collectors
        aiming to preserve their cards for the long term. The materials used are free from harmful
        acids and PVC, preventing potential damage to the cards over time. This archival-grade
        feature is especially crucial for those with rare or vintage cards, ensuring that the
        sleeves contribute to the preservation of their monetary and sentimental value. The top
        loader sleeves have proven to be versatile in accommodating different card thicknesses.
        Whether I'm housing standard trading cards or thicker specialty cards, these sleeves offer
        flexibility without compromising on protection. This adaptability is appreciated, allowing
        me to use the same sleeves for various cards within my collection. The purchase experience
        was seamless, with the sleeves arriving promptly and securely packaged. The user-friendly
        design of the packaging, including clear labeling and quantity information, made it easy to
        organize and store the sleeves for future use. In conclusion, the top loader trading card
        sleeves have proven to be an essential investment for any serious collector. Their robust
        construction, clarity, archival quality, and versatility make them a standout choice for
        protecting and showcasing trading card collections. If you're looking to preserve the
        integrity and visual appeal of your valuable cards, these top loader sleeves are a reliable
        and worthwhile addition to your collecting arsenal.</text>

      <text>My son asked for these for Christmas. He put his Pokemon cards in them. These were a
        really good brand, they have seemed to hold up very well. We have not had any problems with
        them. They came in a timely manner, they were wrapped good and all in all they have been
        exactly what we were looking for.</text>

      <text>They are nice but I had about 15 per box that were stuck together from what appears to
        be excess heat during manufacturing. They had to be cracked open to be able to put in a
        card. This left a few marks on the inside of the toploader which I did not like so they were
        discarded. Overall this is a mediocre purchase. Thanks</text>

      <text>This is a mostly fair deal, did have the autos and rares as described. Only issue is
        cards are just put in a thin cardboard box, a few did have penny sleeves but most are not
        protected. This is unfortunate as some of the cards are damaged or maybe they were like that
        when it was put together for sale. All in all not a terrible deal just wish the cards were
        cared for better for the price.</text>

      <text>This was a gift for my nephew this Christmas. He was stoked with all the cards that were
        in there. Some of the signed ones the rookies he kept finding made his night. He had an

      <text>We got this for our son for Christmas because he has recently became obsessed with
        baseball/football/basketball cards. He was so excited with this and loves that it holds so
        many cards. It is very well made and durable. We love the design and the extra caution taken
        on how the card slots are designed to prevent cards from falling out. Would definitely
        recommend!</text>

      <text>Well, starting with the good about the binder, the pockets are a great size for ease
        putting cards in. I've bought other similar binders and sometimes the slots are just a bit
        too small and make feel like I'm really working to cram the card in, but these were smooth.
        The picture is very true to what you will be getting and the overall quality is pretty good.
        The bad (likely only for me) is that one I received had some damage to the outer part of the
        binder. I'm not sure what the inner material is made from, but seems like a reasonably rigid
        cardboard type of material and mine was pretty badly bent up in the upper right hand corner
        (the packaging looked alright, but I'm guessing maybe something was set on it in shipping?).
        It left some permanent damage and though I tried my best to bend it back into shape, the
        damage is just obvious to be frustrating but just annoying enough for me not to want to take
        out all my cards once I discovered packing it didn't "fill it out" enough to get riddle of
        the "bubble" in the front that came from being damaged, so i opted not ask for request a
        return. So overall, it seems to be very good, but if you do receive one with damage, I'd
        recommend returning it rather than attempting to see if filling it or attempting to bend the
        damage back to looking "normal" or else you might be stuck moving 1000+ cards.</text>

      <text>I had fun opening this pack. Lots of variety in cards and there were a lot of
        basic/stage 1 evolution chains included. It seems like the people putting these together
        actually care about the experience for the person buying/opening the pack. Only 2 duplicates
        (I like duplicates for the deck building, but a lot of reviewers don‚Äôt like that with other
        sellers). I‚Äôm about to buy a few more and hope for the same result!</text>

      <text>Most of the cards were good but one of the four packs I ordered came with the edge bent
        on about half the pack. I assume from the way it looked, someone forced the cards into the
        box. Worst of all the half that got bent included the foil cards.</text>

      <text>Got these as a gift along with a new card binder and the person I gave them to spent 2
        full days opening them and going thru them and talking about them. So on that alone it was a
        huge hit. There were many names that I remembered from years ago. Were any of them worth
        anything? NO idea. Who cares? To get 100 cards and spend a couple days going thru them and
        learning all about the players and the game was worth it alone to me. Now, it looks like we
        will be buying more locally and online. The cards are good quality and I got them all new
        and unopened.</text>

      <text>I am satisfied with this 100 count of mystery baseball cards. It had players from todays
        game, as well as the 2000s, 1990s, even a couple 1980s. There were no hits (relics or autos)
        but they did have a fantastic variety from big name players to some guys you may have never
        heard of. These cards were of different eras, different teams, and they were in good shape.
        Most cards would fall as a Near-Mint on my self grading scale, some were as good as Mint,
        and some were simply good-excellent as I did notice frayed corners and creases in the
        corners of a couple cards. Pros: Great variety Good quantity Thoughtfully selected Cons:
        None Overall I am satisfied and would definitely recommend this set to anyone looking to
        start/build their collection, or anyone looking for a gift for a collector!</text>

      <text>So this pack of 100 baseball cards was ok. I found Daryl Strawberry, Roberto Alomar, and
        John Kruk. I also found a couple more recent players like C.C. Sabathia, Willson Contreras,
        and a little less recent Juan Gonzalez card. It wasn't too bad of a haul but I do wonder
        whether these cards will not have their value due to possible factory defects. All in all it
        really wasn't worth almost 30 bucks. There should have Bern a lot more cards and more
        noticeable names in there. There were virtually no rookie cards and a lit of the good cards
        that were in there were from years that weren't notable in the players careers. It was fun
        to look through them though.</text>

      <text>When it arrived it looked like it was going to be all flimsy so I set it aside for 2
        weeks. Then I started putting it together. Ease of assembly only really applies if a) you
        have electric screwdriver or b) have a monster's strength in your own hands; however, after
        borrowing a tool it got done. Once it is all together it really does the job well. It is
        sturdy and holds all of the pieces I want in it. I feel it is a good value for the money.</text>

      <text>This cabinet is pretty good considering its on a budget. My biggest complaint is that
        they didn't drill holes to make the placement of shelves more customizable and some of the
        holes for the pegs aren't lined up properly. For instance the first top shelf is perfectly
        lined up for ps1 and Dreamcast games but I cant properly line up a shelf to accommodate a
        2nd shelf below it to hold my ps1 games. There's a nice big gap for shelf two that doesn't
        have the same quality as the first top shelf for storing ps1 games because the holes aren't
        lined up to do so. When you're building it can feel a bit iffy and wobbly until you complete
        it with the backboard then it becomes a lot more sturdy just be careful when you put it
        together so you don't pull the screws out accidentally lol Overall its a pretty solid budget
        option, I'll buy more of these and hope they improve on the design in the future. Whoever is
        in charge of this product should take Q&amp;A from gamers as I can tell most people who buys
        these are gaming collectors. So for anyone who is buying this to store their game collection
        its going to be like this per shelf most likely for you. Top shelf PS1,Dreamcast or 3DS/DS
        games, 2nd shelf weirdly gapped storage for the same as the top shelf but you will stack
        them horizontally instead of vertically like the top shelf, 3rd shelf will be good for blu
        ray sized cases such as ps3,ps4 and xbox one/series x games. 4th and 5th shelf good for DVD
        sized cases such as og xbox/xbox 360 and ps2 games. 5th shelf for switch games although will
        fit a little tight and also you could stack more cd sized cases like ps1 or dreamcast
        horizontally again. bottom shelf will have the most headroom which is annoying because it
        feels like a waste of space due to the inefficient design but will hold more og xbox /xbox
        360 cases and perhaps some type of sealed collectors edition box instead. Overall it does a
        decent job for the price, just wish it was a bit more sturdy and the design was more
        efficient. ordered 2 of these and will most likely order a third when I need more storage
        for my collection. Bottom line if you're looking for storage on a budget these are pretty
        good to go with, they dont look half bad either. Just know there are some quirks that comes
        with it.</text>

      <text>When I unpacked it everything looked great but that was the first impression. It was
        well packed. The problems started when I assembled it. The dowels were loose in the holes
        and did not provide much support so I glued them even though there was no instruction to do
        so. There are some metal pegs that connect with circular fittings that lock with a quarter
        turn, one of these broke when I locked it, but I thought well maybe just one bad one. I
        noticed that none of these locked well because they were poor quality. However I persevered
        and completed the carcase thinking it would be ok and did seem reasonably sturdy when I got
        the back installed. When I installed the shelves however was when I decided this was going
        to be returned. The shelf pins were a sloppy fit in the holes and the holes were not aligned
        correctly when they were drilled so the shelves wobbled real bad, as much as 3/8 inch on
        some of them. I have bought self assembly furniture in the past from Amazon and it has been
        good quality and great when assembled, but this item I would not even have given one star if
        I could have given a zero. I disassembled it and it will be returned. What a waste of
        time!!!</text>

      <text>Unit requires small ‚Äúcam locks‚Äù for proper assembly, but many of mine were cracked and
        unusable (see photo). I contacted the manufacturer and they promptly sent out a replacement
        set of hardware, but that took 13 days to arrive, meaning I was stuck with half-finished,
        unusable shelves sitting in my living room for nearly two weeks. What‚Äôs more, assembly
        proved somewhat difficult. I‚Äôm really good at assembling kit furniture and have successfully
        built IKEA pieces many times. But this unit was a troublesome build; inverting the unit to
        nail in its backing pieces was tricky, as the main pieces wanted to ‚Äúcome apart‚Äù when this
        was done. Ultimately I managed to get it done, but it wasn‚Äôt easy!</text>

      <text>I have shipped countless cards , card breaks &amp; sports cards lots online . These do
        in fact fit in team bags . I prefer to use SGC graded card bags . The best thing about this
        product is that you can now safely send single or double sports cards taped to 1 or even 2
        of these dent defenders.It‚Äôs thin enough to allow you to utilize eBay‚Äôs $1 shipping with a
        tracking number ( saves lots of money over Bmwt ) . These also have a little flexibility and
        that slight bend means they usps doesn‚Äôt destroy your product putting plain envelopes into
        their sorters . This is crucial for customer retention .The price point beats the
        competition and these guys ship FAST . It‚Äôs been a long time since I left a review but it‚Äôs
        been a long time since a purchase truly exceeded my expectations ! Bravo Dent Defender !</text>

        aiming to preserve their cards for the long term. The materials used are free from harmful
        acids and PVC, preventing potential damage to the cards over time. This archival-grade
        feature is especially crucial for those with rare or vintage cards, ensuring that the
        sleeves contribute to the preservation of their monetary and sentimental value. The top
        loader sleeves have proven to be versatile in accommodating different card thicknesses.

        construction, clarity, archival quality, and versatility make them a standout choice for
        protecting and showcasing trading card collections. If you're looking to preserve the

      <text>My son asked for these for Christmas. He put his Pokemon cards in them. These were a
        really good brand, they have seemed to hold up very well. We have not had any problems with
        them. They came in a timely manner, they were wrapped good and all in all they have been
        exactly what we were looking for.</text>

      <text>They are nice but I had about 15 per box that were stuck together from what appears to
        be excess heat during manufacturing. They had to be cracked open to be able to put in a
        card. This left a few marks on the inside of the toploader which I did not like so they were
        discarded. Overall this is a mediocre purchase. Thanks</text>

      <text>These booster packs are totally worth the wait for shipping and buying! I remember
        having my mother buy them for me as a kid. Totally relived my childhood and loved opening
        them. Even my mother joined in and opened some with me lol. I bought series 1,2, and 3 on
        amazon. I did have a couple of the boxes only have 35 packs instead of 36 but, that can be a
        simple manufacturing issue. It is still totally worth unboxing and putting them in your
        lovely binders, for that mint condition experience. Duplicates can be played with as it is a
        trading card game to test your nostalgia of Webkinz world!</text>

      <text>The cards got here quickly, were in amazing condition and I got so much amazing stuff
        out of it. My favorite thing though was the Webkinz. While not my first choice, I still
        adore her. I am totally gonna but these again.</text>

      <text>This was exactly what was described by the description, I had a sealed pack and I got
        one pet from it!! Lots of other cute furnitures and foods from the other codes, and the card
        game looks like its a fun little experience. I'd absolutely suggest these!</text>

      <text>The box came with 36 playing card packages. Each package came with 1 featured code card
        (some cards contained multiple codes). None of the codes were previously used. I did not get
        an animal with any of my codes but did get about 5K in KinzCash and many many items.
        Overall, it was worth it to me and will be ordering more.</text>

      <text>Ok so honest review this was really fun to open and you get 36 card packs with 6 cards
        per pack so a little over 200 cards. I got tons of furniture items some rare and some are
        stuff you can get from the W shop. There were some duplicate codes but mostly you got a fair
        selection of rare mech. There was one pet code which wasn't a rare pet but still fun to
        adopt and i depends on the pack you get. I got about 67 duplicate cards with about 4-5
        duplicate codes. However you can trade your duplicate cards and send the gifts to friends or
        give them to your other pets. So in all I do recommend this.</text>

      <text>I always wanted these cards as a child but never could get them, but now that I'm an
        adult with adult money I bought em, opened them all up and even got a pet code! I welcomed a
        Dalmatian to my Webkinz family, my brother and I named him David Spade lmao, if you're still
        a fan of Webkinz and still play the code cards still 100% work!</text>
